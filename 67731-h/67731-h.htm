RALPH STUART, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Stuart</span>: I dedicate this book to you as a memento
of our delightful hours of travel and work together in writing the play&mdash;&#8220;A
Courier of Fortune&#8221;&mdash;founded upon this story. The circumstances
of our joint literary work were as unusual to me as they were
fascinating; for, although the play was commenced in London, the last
&#8220;curtain&#8221; was not written until my wife and I had crossed the Atlantic
and journeyed with you on a tour of over ten thousand miles of railway
travelling, through so many of the marvels of this wonderful Continent.
St. Louis; Denver; Salt Lake City; San Francisco; the Pacific Seaboard
north to Puget Sound; the fertile Palouse Country; Washington,
Idaho, and Montana&mdash;those wealthy States of boundless promise and
marvellous scenic contrasts; the cities of the Lakes, Duluth and Superior;
then the young giant twins, St. Paul and Minneapolis; and by
way of Milwaukee and Chicago to New York. A tour of momentous
interest and a collaboration of close-knit sympathy, cementing a friendship
which, I assure you, is one of the pleasantest things of my life.</p>

<small>THE &#8220;TIGER OF MORVAIX&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE hot noontide sun was pouring down into the
market place of Morvaix and in the shadow cast
by the great Cross of St. Jean in the centre, a
handsome but very soberly dressed cavalier was sheltering
from the fierce July heat and closely observing the
townspeople as they clustered here and there to engage
in eager animated discussion. Every now and then he
cast sweeping impatient glances in all directions in evident
search of some one whose delay irritated him.</p>

<p>It was plain even to a stranger&#8217;s eyes that the townsfolk
were greatly excited, and that the reason which had
drawn the people from their houses was both urgent and
disturbing. All classes were present&mdash;burghers, merchants,
shopkeepers, workmen, &#8217;prentices, down to the
poorest of the labourers and peasants. Men, women
and children alike were gathered there; the men set-faced
and bitter, the women sad and anxious. Discontent,
anger, fear and sorrow were the emotions evinced among
all save the many soldiers who moved among the excited
knots, with leers for the women and oaths for the men,
and jibes and ribald laughter one to another.</p>

<p>The young cavalier&#8217;s face darkened as he listened, and
more than once he started as if he would interfere, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
checked himself. His keen, quick blue eyes were everywhere;
and presently catching sight of two closely-cowled
monks clad in the black habit of their order, who showed
at a secluded corner of the square, he left his shelter and
went toward them quickly but cautiously.</p>

<p>As he reached them one gave him a monkish greeting
and the other a military salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;I half feared you had forgotten the appointment,&#8221; he
said, in a tone of authority; &#8220;and you are certainly forgetting
your part, Pascal. Monks don&#8217;t salute like
soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it?&#8221; was the reply, laughingly spoken.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t trained all our tough fellows in the monkish
drill for nothing. I&#8217;ll tell my beads against Dubois here
for a stoup of wine&#8221;; and taking in hand the rosary
which hung conspicuously at his side, he commenced to
mumble a string of nonsense words, and laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, man, peace!&#8221; said the other monk, much older
in years. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be overheard and ruin all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tush! they&#8217;ll only think it&#8217;s my priestly Latin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I ought to have left you in Paris, Pascal,&#8221; said
the cavalier. &#8220;I was warned your unruly tongue would
play the mischief with a scheme that calls for tact and
silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my lord&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not, my lord, here. I am not Gerard de Bourbon for
a few days. I have borrowed the name of that dicing
scoundrel, Raoul de Cobalt, and am Gerard de Cobalt.
Remember that, and watch your words until you have
learnt that lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not forget. This holy man here, Dubois, will
keep me in order,&#8221; answered Pascal with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the news, Dubois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All has gone as you wished. The men have all
arrived; and yesterday I sought an interview with the
Governor and did all as you had directed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>&#8220;He swallowed the bait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Readily. I told him that the Cardinal Archbishop
had sent him a hundred fighting men for his troops, and
craved permission for the hundred begging friars to remain
in the city until the pilgrimage southward could be
resumed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought the monks in,&#8221; interposed Pascal. &#8220;A
hundred tough stalwarts, every man as sober as a begging
friar should be; all telling their beads with unctuous
unanimity, uttering &#8216;Pax Vobiscum&#8217; with fervid zeal,
and praying as only Bourbons can pray&mdash;for a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a care, brother,&#8221; cried Dubois quickly, as a knot
of the townsfolk passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not always care, holy brother?&#8221; cried Pascal,
taking his rosary in hand again and mumbling his Paternoster
in tones loud enough to reach the passers&#8217; ears.
&#8220;A fine achievement, M. de Cobalt, but it will not last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What mean you?&#8221; asked Gerard quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers are soldiers, and it takes more than a monk&#8217;s
gabardine to change them. When pretty girls come buzzing
round, craving &#8216;A blessing, holy father,&#8217; and looking
so sweet and piteous, it&#8217;s not in nature, at least in
soldiers&#8217; nature, not to kiss &#8217;em. Cherry lips lifted in
supplication are strong enemies of this new discipline.
I know it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame, Pascal!&#8221; cried Dubois sternly. &#8220;Are we
to betray everything for a pair of laughing eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything can happen when there&#8217;s a shapely nose, a
kissable mouth, and two soft cheeks to complete the face.
Let there be haste, I say, or, Bourbons or no Bourbons,
those lips will get kissed; and then there may be the devil
to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is reason in his madcap words, Dubois,&#8221; said
Gerard after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, even a fool can tell the truth,&#8221; laughed Pascal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;But we must wait till I have proofs. When the news
of this governor&#8217;s evil doings came to my father&#8217;s ears he
sent me to learn the truth; and while bidding me act as I
would, enjoined me to do nothing until I had clear proofs.
A Bourbon does not act on mere rumours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proofs!&#8221; broke in Pascal with a swift change to
earnestness. &#8220;In the devil&#8217;s name, what better proof of
the man&#8217;s deeds could you find than that which is writ
large on the wretched, starving faces of the people?
Look at them&mdash;faces that the devil grins to see when he
would tempt men and women to sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in during the night only, and have seen little
or nothing yet,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;What is the meaning
of this gathering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This devil spawn of a governor has a new ordinance
to proclaim, a new tyranny to enact,&#8221; said Pascal. &#8220;He
will tax afresh to half its value every ounce of foodstuff
that comes into the city. As if the poor wretches were
not already half-starving. And this tax will finish them.
Look at them and say if the Governor is not justly
dubbed the Tiger of Morvaix? They are waiting his coming
now with the heralds. Of a truth I would as lief
dwell in hell as in Morvaix under Bourbon sway though
it be in name, and Bourbon as I am to the core.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had other and weightier matters to occupy
us than the troubles of a small province so remote,&#8221; said
Gerard, with a frown at Pascal&#8217;s words. &#8220;But if the
tale of wrongs be warranted, the Governor, Duke de
Rochelle though he be, will answer to me for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all reports he will answer to no man but himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough, Pascal,&#8221; said Gerard, with a wave of the
hand. &#8220;There appear to be over many soldiers, Dubois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And report says theirs are the only mouths that
take enough food,&#8221; broke in Pascal. &#8220;Your fighting
man must be fed, of course; but when it comes to feeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
him with the food for which all others starve, it is
first cousin to cannibalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The number of the soldiery has surprised me,&#8221; said
Dubois seriously. &#8220;They are far too many for our
small band to do much. It is well your cousin&#8217;s army
lies so close to Cambrai. This governor will fight hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If his soldiers are loyal to him, it argues in his
favour,&#8221; replied Gerard thoughtfully. &#8220;We know to
what lengths the burghers of a town may be driven by
their jealousy of us soldiers. We must wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we wait but a little while there will be no
grievances left. Those who have them will be dead,&#8221;
cried Pascal with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no taunts of yours, Pascal, to stir me to do
great Bourbon&#8217;s will,&#8221; answered Gerard with some
sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant no taunt, and spoke only my mind as
friend to friend,&#8221; said Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor is coming now,&#8221; put in Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better not be seen longer together. Where
shall I find you at need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke has lodged Pascal and myself in his
castle,&#8221; answered Dubois, and the two were turning
away when Gerard exclaimed, in a tone of excitement&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Dubois, see, that man riding by the side of
the Governor. Do you recognize him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that villain, de Proballe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old rat, so it is,&#8221; declared Pascal. &#8220;If there is
devil&#8217;s work to be done in Morvaix he&#8217;ll be in it. Paris
was too hot for him. I thought he was in hell by now.
By the saints, he is long overdue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard did not wait to hear the conclusion of the
speech, but mingling with the crowd watched the proceedings
with close interest.</p>

<p>It was a very strong force of soldiery, both horse
and foot, that gathered in the market place round the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
statue, large enough to brush away like so many flies
the crowd of citizens, who fell back hushed and awe-stricken
before the muskets and halberds which were
used with much wilful violence.</p>

<p>The Governor of the city, the Duke Charles de
Rochelle, seated on his charger, a magnificent coal black
Flemish animal, drew up in the centre of the cleared
space, and gazed with amused contemptuousness upon
the shrinking burghers.</p>

<p>He made a striking centre-piece. Short and slight
of figure, yet suggesting suppleness and strength, his
fifty years sat lightly on him. His fair hair had scarce
a touch of grey, and his pointed auburn beard and
flowing moustache might have belonged to a man
twenty years his junior. His features, strong and
regular, would have been handsome but for the small
close-set grey eyes, whose cold, hawk-like glitter was rendered
additionally repulsive by a strong cast.</p>

<p>&#8220;The eyes of a wild beast,&#8221; thought Gerard, who
had been watching him intently. &#8220;Well named the
Tiger.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a signal from the Governor, the herald stepped
forward amid a blare of trumpets and read the proclamation.
The people listened in dead silence; but at
the close, loud murmurs broke out which even the
presence of the soldiery could not wholly check.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means starvation to us,&#8221; cried one lusty voice,
and a powerful fellow, a smith, wielding the heavy
hammer of his trade, broke through the ring of the
soldiers and made as if to approach the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What dog is this that dares to bay?&#8221; It was the
Duke who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no dog, my lord, but a burgher of Morvaix,
and I do but speak what all here know,&#8221; answered the
smith sturdily.</p>

<p>The Duke fixed his keen eyes on the man&#8217;s face, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
without a word signed to some of those about him.
Three soldiers sprang toward the smith, who faced
them fearlessly, and lifted his hammer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done no wrong. No man shall touch me,&#8221;
he said threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with the rebel dog,&#8221; cried the Duke; and at
the words the soldiers, who had hesitated, rushed upon
the smith. Two went down with broken heads from
blows of the terrible hammer; but the third got his
halberd in, and as the man lay on the ground some
others dashed forward and one of them thrust home
to his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;So perish all rebels,&#8221; cried the Governor, in a
ringing tone to the crowd; and at the threat and the
sight of the smith&#8217;s blood the people shrank together
and cowered.</p>

<p>The Duke smiled coldly on the crowd, and without
another word signed for the procession to reform and
march on, the people shrinking and cowering in silence
from the troops as they passed.</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s hot blood had fired at the scene, and he
stood looking after the Governor with a heart hot with
indignant anger at the foul injustice he had witnessed.</p>

<p>His two followers in monkish garb crossed to him
and as the three whispered together, they were startled
by the sound of a woman&#8217;s wailing. It was the dead
man&#8217;s wife. She had heard the news and came rushing
upon the scene in wild disordered distress, carrying
her babe in her arms.</p>

<p>As she was nearing the body, a girl attended by a
page, whose attire evidenced his mistress&#8217; high station,
met her and with tender solicitude offered such consolation
as was possible.</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s gaze, attracted by the girl&#8217;s beauty, followed
the couple as together they approached the body, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
had now been lifted by some of the sympathizing townsfolk;
and then with a cry of anger he dashed hotly
toward them, followed by his companions.</p>

<p>There was indeed cause for his anger. Several of
the brutal soldiers had rushed upon the men carrying
the corpse, and with oaths and blows and threats of
the Duke&#8217;s anger, seized the body from them and flung
it on the ground.</p>

<p>The girl, courageously placing herself between the
soldiers and the frightened townsfolk, had turned upon
the former and ordered them away; but the bullies,
strong in the protection of their tyrant master and
presuming on their license to deal as they would with
the people, first jeered at her coarsely and then thrust
her roughly aside while one of them ran and kicked the
corpse with wanton brutality.</p>

<p>It was the attack on the girl which drove Gerard to
interfere. He was by her side in an instant, flung the
man who had touched her to the ground, and with
eyes flashing and hand on his sword, dared the men to
interfere further.</p>

<p>The soldiers were still present in the square in great
force, however, and attracted by the tumult many came
rallying to the side of their comrades. At the same
time, inspirited by Gerard&#8217;s daring, a great crowd of
the townsfolk closed up behind him; and it seemed impossible
that a conflict could be avoided.</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation, however, while
the two opposing bodies glared angrily at one another,
and Pascal with ready wit seized it to step between
them, and with uplifted crucifix threatened the soldiers
with the ban of Holy Church if they attempted further
violence to either dead or living.</p>

<p>While he was haranguing them in loud and vehement
tones, a number of men in monkish dress appeared
almost as if by magic, and pushing through the citizens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
ranged themselves at his side, thus giving an impressive
background to his exhortation.</p>

<p>The soldiers, abashed by this strange opposition, hung
back in doubt, and the citizens having in the meanwhile
borne the dead body away, the trouble ended
in nothing more serious than muttered threats and
oaths from the soldiers and stern remonstrances from
the monks.</p>

<p>When the soldiers had drawn off, Gerard turned to
seek the girl the attack on whom had provoked him
to interfere, but she had vanished.</p>

<p>With an eagerness which brought a smile to Pascal&#8217;s
face, Gerard plied those about him with questions
regarding her, and learnt that she was Mademoiselle de
Malincourt, and had gone away to comfort the trouble-stricken
woman whose husband had been the victim of
the morning&#8217;s tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did shrewdly, Pascal,&#8221; said Dubois, when the
two were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our good fellows won&#8217;t thank me, for, like myself,
their fingers were tingling to be at some of the rascals&#8217;
throats. Where&#8217;s the young lord, Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone in search of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Pascal&#8217;s laugh interposed
to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye. We can understand. There&#8217;s a woman
in the thing now, of course. And we shall hear more
of her, or I am a monk indeed, and no soldier, which
God forfend.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE MAISON DE MALINCOURT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME two or three hours after the scene in the
market place a girl sat at her spinning wheel on
the terrace of the Maison de Malincourt, opposite
the head of the stately flight of steps leading down to
the wide gardens. She had placed her wheel in an
angle of the southern turret so that she could ply her task
in comfort, protected from the rays of the July sun.</p>

<p>She was Lucette de Boisdegarde, the foster sister and
close friend of Mademoiselle de Malincourt, for whose
coming she was now waiting with as much patience
as her quick vivacious temperament permitted.</p>

<p>Her industry was only fitful. At times her shapely
little foot pressed with insistent vigour upon the
treadle and the wheel flew round rapidly, as if keeping
pace with the thoughts that drew her dark pretty face
into a frown of petulance and made her large eyes
flash with gathering purpose. But the wheel was often
still and she would sit back, idly fingering the threads
of gleaming flax and thinking, while her gaze would
roam over the blaze of lovely flowers in the garden, or
stray away to the red roofs of the city which showed
through the skirting trees beyond, or rest curiously on
the vacant seat at her side on the cushions of which
lay some needlework.</p>

<p>She was in one of these preoccupied moods when her
sharp ear caught the sound of a footstep. In a moment
she set the treadle of her wheel whirling swiftly, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
she crooned to herself the air of a ballad of the time,
and appeared too deeply engrossed in her work and
song to have eyes or ears for anything else.</p>

<p>Yet young Denys St. Jean was worth looking at.
Well-built he was, soldierly in bearing and self-reliant
in mien, with a fair frank honest face, though now grave
with thought and purpose, as he turned the corner of
the Maison at a slow deliberate pace.</p>

<p>Seeing Lucette he started and his face brightened;
and he smiled as he perceived her absorption in her
task was overacted. He hesitated just an instant as
if about to speak to her, but with a slight frown checked
the inclination, walked on a few paces, lingered again,
and then stopped.</p>

<p>Lucette meanwhile was treading her wheel vigorously
and singing sweetly to herself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There was once a maiden in Arcady,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose lover so feal and true</div>
<div class="verse">Came riding forth from the sullen north</div>
<div class="verse">Her sweet white hand to woo.</div>
</div></div>

<p>During the verse Denys stood with his back to the
singer, his arms folded in an attitude suggestive of
antagonism; but once or twice, when he half-turned
toward her, the smile on his lips and the light in his
eyes told of very different feelings.</p>

<p>When the song ceased he maintained his attitude of
indifference, keeping his back to her and his arms still
folded, waiting for her to speak; but when she gave
no sign that she knew of his presence, he turned and
stole up behind her softly, with a smile of expectation,
and bent over her.</p>

<p>Her industry and absorption appeared to increase,
however, and her foot pressed the treadle, the wheel
flew round, and her white fingers flashed hither and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
thither, tending the flax, gathering the thread, adjusting
this and smoothing that, while all the while she crooned
the old ballad.</p>

<p>Her patience beat him at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Antoine, I knew your tread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antoine!&#8221; exclaimed Denys with an angry start,
&#8220;what do you mean by that, Lucette?&#8221;</p>

<p>The wheel stopped and she looked round, her face a
pretty mask of coquettish surprise and her eyes beaming
with mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, it is not Antoine!&#8221; with just a suggestion of
disappointment in the tone, a little shrug of the shapely
shoulders, and a pout. &#8220;Only you. I thought you
were gone for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive me away, if you treat me like this.
What did you mean about knowing Antoine&#8217;s tread?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a second she let her roguish eyes rest on his, and
then she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;His feet are so big and so clumsy,&#8221; she said, and
turned again to her wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you meet him so often you can
recognize them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Recognize them! Mon Dieu, they are not feet to
forget when once seen,&#8221; she cried lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t pass it off like that, Lucette. Were you
expecting him here this afternoon? Is that what you
mean?&#8221; He was still angry and his tone very earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect <i>you</i>, Monsieur Catechist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you meant to amuse yourself with him in my
absence?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and made a pretty grimace of dismay
and spread out her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it an hour since you said you would never speak
to me again? What then does it matter to you? Would
you play the dog in the manger?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Will you answer my question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you come back at all when all is at an end
between us? You said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know why I come back?&#8221; The tone
was full of feeling; but Lucette merely shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see if you had made me miserable, I suppose?
You have not;&#8221; and she burst again into her song,
when Denys caught her by the wrist, and looked intently
into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you don&#8217;t care, Lucette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care not to have my arm bruised with your great
clumsy hands. Antoine would never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with your Antoine!&#8221; he burst in vehemently.
&#8220;You play with me as a cat with a bird;&#8221;
and throwing her hand from him he turned and strode
away. He got no farther than the corner of the house,
and looking back saw her leaning against the wall
nursing her arm as if in pain. &#8220;Forgive me, Lucette,&#8221;
he cried remorsefully, hastening back. &#8220;I am a brute;
you fire my blood when you make me jealous. If you
love Antoine de Cavannes better than me, say so now,
and let me go. But don&#8217;t torture me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood nursing her arm and looking up at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torture <i>you</i>, is it? Torture <i>you</i>?&#8221; and she held
her arm up in reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have only to say the word, and I&#8217;ll never
trouble you again. It can&#8217;t be both Antoine and me.
Choose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choose!&#8221; she repeated, mocking his serious tone.
Then with a laugh and a change to coquettish hesitation:
&#8220;Hot-tempered, handsome Denys or splay-footed,
ugly Antoine, eh? It can&#8217;t be both of you, eh? And
if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, can&#8217;t you be serious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am, I&#8217;ll choose neither of you, but just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
bury myself in a nunnery. So good-bye, my lord
surly-face;&#8221; and she burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that good-bye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did I wish you anything but good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll drive me away from you and from Morvaix,&#8221;
he said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll soon be back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you can play with me as you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid! As if I cared where you go! But you
can&#8217;t leave Gabrielle. You can be many nasty things,
but at least you can&#8217;t be untrue to your trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>His angry features relaxed somewhat at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could read your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So does Antoine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angered again at this, a hot retort was stayed on
his lips as Gabrielle de Malincourt stepped out of one
of the tall windows of the terrace close to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my good Denys, and, of course, Lucette,&#8221; she
said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be the other order, mademoiselle, I fear,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Lucette, and of course, Denys. It is
Denys who is &#8216;of course.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle glanced at them both and understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quarrelling again! Lucette, Lucette. You treat
him villainously. But never mind, Denys. I know
what&#8217;s in her heart whatever her lips may say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Lucette in protest, when
Gabrielle interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know what you would say. But I am
not Denys. When the sea is very calm some people
like to rock a boat to make pretence; but when the
storm comes in reality it&#8217;s all very different. Wait till
there comes a bit of a storm, Denys, and you&#8217;ll see the
truth. If Lucette had been I just now in the market
place and you had been at hand, you would have seen
to whom she would have turned.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Has anything chanced, mademoiselle?&#8221; asked Denys
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That which made me wish for you, good Denys. I
had visited poor old Jacques Boulanger and was returning
through the market place just when the heralds
had proclaimed this new and shameful ordinance of
the Governor&#8217;s&mdash;a tax so cruel that it makes my blood
boil. A terrible thing occurred. Babillon, the smith,
sprang forward to protest, and the Governor, holding
him for a rebel, had him done to death there on the
spot by his brutal soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How horrible!&#8221; exclaimed Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, mademoiselle?&#8221; asked Denys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had just heard the news when his wife came
rushing through the place like one distraught, and I
was seeking to comfort her in her anguish when the
soldiers&mdash;oh, they are fiends, those men!&mdash;attacked the
citizens who had lifted the smith&#8217;s body to bear it home,
flung the dead on the ground, and when, burning with
indignation, I ordered them to desist, they turned on
me, one of them thrust me violently aside, and would
have done I know not what next, had not a cavalier,
a stranger, rushed up to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I had been there, mademoiselle!&#8221; exclaimed
Denys angrily. &#8220;Would you know the fellow again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the stranger cavalier?&#8221; asked Lucette,
with a light of mischief in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Lucette, do not jest,&#8221; said Gabrielle earnestly.
&#8220;The man was punished for his act, Denys. The
cavalier struck him to the ground and faced the whole
of them fearlessly; and I dreaded for a moment that a
conflict would follow, for there are not many in Morvaix
who would see me harmed. But a monk intervened
then and the danger was averted. Babillon&#8217;s
body was carried away, and I went with the wretched
woman whom I have but now left, all desolate, broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and whelmed by her sorrow. These are ill days indeed
for Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the men who maltreated you, mademoiselle, can
be found, nay, must be found and punished,&#8221; cried
Denys warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of no matter now, Denys. It is over; beside
the cruel wrongs done to the people, my little hurt is
nothing. These soldiers, moreover, are but hirelings,
and do no more than hirelings&#8217; work. But there is one
quest&mdash;you must find the cavalier who served me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You learnt his name, Gabrielle?&#8221; she asked
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, for I left the place with Babillon&#8217;s wife&mdash;wife
alas! no more, but widow, poor soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cavalier, Gabrielle, was he handsome as well
as brave?&#8221; asked Lucette after a pause.</p>

<p>A faint tinge of colour tinted Gabrielle&#8217;s cheeks as
she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;In truth, I scarce had time to see, Lucette; but he
seemed in all respects a manly man, a figure of distinction
truly. Tall and knightly in mien; his face
unbearded and full of strength, yet kindly and courteous;
fair in colouring; and his blue eyes, keen and flashing
fire as he faced the soldiery, were gentle and solicitous
when viewing my plight; his voice resolute with the
tone of one accustomed to command; yet tuned to gentle
accents, as it seemed to me. I much mistake me if he
be not a knight of loftier station than his sober brown
attire would seem to bespeak him. A most gallant
gentleman and a brave heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw much, cousin, it seems, although you had
no time, as you say;&#8221; and Lucette, with a smile to
herself, turned to her spinning wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will seek him out, mademoiselle,&#8221; said Denys,
&#8220;and no doubt shall find him. Shall I give him any
message?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;I could not even stay to thank him, and would
wish to do so. Let him know as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I go, there is a grave matter on which I
would speak with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, Denys, but afterward. He must not
think Gabrielle de Malincourt ungrateful. I beg you
hasten at once in quest of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; he answered, and turning toward Lucette,
said nervously: &#8220;Lucette, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can finish our quarrel when you return,&#8221; she
interposed. &#8220;I may forgive you if you do Gabrielle&#8217;s
service quickly.&#8221; Her tone was one of indifference,
but he read the smile in her eyes and went with a light
quick step upon his errand.</p>

<p>Gabrielle had dropped into the vacant seat by Lucette
and now leant back thinking, her lips slightly parted
and her eyes dreamy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a handsome man, coz, this cavalier of
yours?&#8221; Gabrielle started at the question and then met
her friend&#8217;s half-quizzing look calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen a nobler, Lucette. I hope our
good Denys will find him. Why do you plague that
good fellow so sorely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, it is he plagues me. He is always quarrelling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> are always finding cause to make him, you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a man, and must be kept in his place;&#8221; and
Lucette shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;By bickering and teasing and wrangling? Does it
please you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always the making up again;&#8221; and Lucette
laughed roguishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware how you try him too much. He is sterling
mettle.&#8221; She paused and suppressed a sigh as she
added: &#8220;How happy you should be!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Lucette glanced across at her and her manner
changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thinking again, Gabrielle. You are not
sad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was thinking. I ought not to be sad, to-day
of all days; and yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The rest of the sentence
was an unmistakable sigh, deep and sincere.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may prove a gallant cavalier, Gabrielle, your
Gerard; as gallant maybe as your hero of the market
place. Don&#8217;t look like that, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Lucette, horribly afraid. You cannot
tell how it is with me. I am perhaps overwrought by
this terrible scene in the market place, and&mdash;oh, I know
not what I feel;&#8221; and with a shudder she covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will all come right, dear,&#8221; whispered Lucette
gently, after a pause; but the words seemed to jar upon
Gabrielle, who lowered her hands, and with a look of
irritation replied almost petulantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You judge from your own little outlook. You tease
Denys and force a sham quarrel, knowing he will make
it up and all will come right, as you say. But how
would it be with you if you were in my place, given
to a man you had not seen since you were a child; betrothed
to one you know nothing about, and who may
turn out to be&mdash;oh, what am I saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hate him before he came to claim me,
Gabrielle,&#8221; said Lucette vigorously, tearing at the flax
she held in her fingers. &#8220;Claim me!&#8221; she added, incensed
by her own word. &#8220;I would make him feel that
the claiming was no easy task. Oh, I should hate him!
But you need not wed him. You are the mistress of
Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand, Lucette.&#8221; The girl looked
up in genuine surprise at the change in Gabrielle&#8217;s tone,
suddenly calm, proud and cold. &#8220;It is my duty to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
family. My parents ordered it so, and it is not for me
to disobey. I owe it to my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand you, Gabrielle. At one moment
you are a girl with all a girl&#8217;s heart and feelings, and
the next, you are the grand dame, cold, passionless,
proud&mdash;just the embodied spirit of the traditions of
your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you a Malincourt you would understand. I
have to live my life and must perforce be content.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But pride makes an ill substitute for love in a marriage,
Gabrielle. And your motive is pride. If this
M. Gerard de Cobalt, this distant kinsman and unseen
betrothed, should turn out to be a hideous depraved
wretch&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, Lucette; you do but plague me. M. de Cobalt
will be here to-day or to-morrow; and you will remember
he is my affianced husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry my reckless tongue wounds you, Gabrielle.
I love you so dearly;&#8221; and Lucette bent across
and kissed her tenderly. &#8220;Pray God it may all be well
with you. Forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive, dear,&#8221; answered
Gabrielle sweetly. &#8220;You are right. I have two natures;
and if the girl in me rebels sometimes, it is
kinder to check than to encourage rebellion. To-day,
somehow, it is harder than usual to check it. I shall
be glad when M. de Cobalt comes. My uncle gives
me good account of him, and speaks of him as brave
and gallant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does M. de Proballe know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he has never seen him&mdash;at least not for many
years; but he has heard much of him, and from what
he says all should be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what he says,&#8221; commented Lucette, with a
little frown of disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You trouble me, Lucette, with these reflections on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
my uncle. You do not like him, and so would have
me share your feeling. We&#8217;ll say no more;&#8221; and with
a sigh she leant back to think.</p>

<p>Lucette, seeing her mood, resumed her work and set
her wheel speeding busily on; but chancing to glance
round a moment later she stopped abruptly with an
exclamation of surprise which attracted Gabrielle&#8217;s
attention.</p>

<p>A man was standing close behind Gabrielle&#8217;s chair
in an attitude of excessive humility. He bowed low
and spread out his hands as she turned to him, while
an expressive curl of contempt drew down the corners
of Lucette&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? Why did you not say you were
here?&#8221; asked Gabrielle sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared to interrupt miladi, and was awaiting your
permission to speak my errand.&#8221; His voice was soft
and his manner deferential.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? Speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My master, the Baron de Proballe, desires to know
if it is convenient for him to wait upon you, miladi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My uncle? Certainly. Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present in his apartments, miladi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him I will see him at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am miladi&#8217;s most humble servant,&#8221; was the reply
with another deep bow, as he went.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a loathsome snake is that Master Dauban,&#8221;
exclaimed Lucette, looking after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My uncle says he is a very honest fellow and as
faithful as a man can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should need a higher character than that,&#8221; said
Lucette with another very expressive shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Baron de Proballe is my uncle, Lucette,&#8221; replied
Gabrielle in a tone of reproach, as she rose to go
into the house. And Lucette, by way of reply, turned
her head away with a toss and made a grimace to
herself as she bent over her wheel.</p>

<small>SINISTER HINTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCARCELY had Gabrielle left the terrace before
Lucette&#8217;s wheel stopped and she began to think
instead of work. Little frowns and smiles chased
each other alternately across her dark expressive face,
and here even pearly teeth showed ever and again between
the full, mobile lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the day&#8217;s adventure changed everything?&#8221; she
mused. &#8220;He seems to have been very handsome, this
gallant cavalier. I wonder. It would be a hard fight.
I know how her pride can stand like a fortress; and I
know how love can pull and pull and pull. Don&#8217;t I
know it?&#8221; and she smiled and sighed in turn. &#8220;Poor
Gabrielle! What a struggle! Heart whispers, &#8216;I love
him&#8217;; pride answers, &#8216;My pledge is given.&#8217; Ah me!
he will have to be a manly man, as she says, if he will
win her. But she will have a traitor in the fortress
after all, if she really love him. Ah me! I know how
it would end with me. But Gabrielle&mdash;well, she is
Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a frown chased away the smiles, for
Master Dauban, the man she had dubbed a snake, came
out from the Maison and approached her.</p>

<p>He was one of those creatures on whom nature sets
the outward marks of his inward character. His whole
appearance and manner suggested slyness and secretiveness.
His light brown shifty eyes were deep set
in his sallow face, his cheeks smooth and round, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
his lips thin and straight; while his voice, unctuous and
oily, and his glances, always quick and restlessly furtive,
no less than the fawning gestures of his hands and his
soft tread proclaimed him a born spy. At least so
Lucette thought, and she hated him accordingly, as she
hated all things mean and base.</p>

<p>But his feeling for her was very far removed from
hatred, and as he came up now his glance was full of
admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the happiest of men to find you alone, Mistress
Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not the happiest of women to find you anywhere&mdash;near
me, Master Dauban,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are as cruel to me as you are beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are as handsome as you are honest,&#8221; she
cried with a shrug. He winced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you always wrong me so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In calling you honest, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in truth a sweet rose, Mistress Lucette,
but the thorns of your wit are sharp and draw blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are meant to prevent snails and slugs from
crawling too near me, Master Dauban.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take all you say in good part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In &#8216;good part.&#8217; And what good part is there in
you, I pray? I have never seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can be a firm friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To yourself, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And an ugly enemy, too, at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette looked him up and down, and her lip curled
as she answered with almost savage contempt&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has fallen so low as to fear you, Master
Dauban? Have you been trounced by some scullion
of the kitchen? You should beware how you offend
any one with hands to strike with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy to scoff, mistress,&#8221; he returned sullenly,
stung by her words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Aye, truly, where you are the object. If you do
not like the truth, go away; you came of your own
will and do not stay by mine. In truth, Malincourt would
be none the worse for your going altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a strong reason for wishing to stay. You
are the reason,&#8221; he said, shooting a glance at her.
&#8220;Why won&#8217;t you let me be your friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one act of friendship you could show
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked eagerly. &#8220;Try me; try
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a hundred leagues between us and never lessen
the distance. It would indeed be an act of true friendship
if you would never let my eyes rest on your face
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a hard saying. I could not live apart from
you,&#8221; he declared with much earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no reason in that why you should not go
away,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;The world could manage to
exist without you; although your master might miss
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not like my master, I fear, Mistress
Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, has he set you to find out what I think of
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell you things,&#8221; he said slyly, lowering his
tone and glancing about him.</p>

<p>She paused a moment and her eyes questioned him.
She checked the mocking reply which was on her lips,
and asked, as if with an assumed indifference, covering
real curiosity&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have eyes to see, ears to hear, and I know what
I know of his plans&mdash;and you would like to know, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette started and bent her head over her wheel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
that her face might not be seen by his ferrety eyes.
She resolved to get it from him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Bah! Am I a fool, Master Dauban, that you would
fill my ears with lies about a good man? You say
truly, the Baron de Proballe is in no favour of mine,
but at least I know him to be an honest, fair-speaking,
straight-dealing gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed unctuously, as from the enjoyable
vantage point of superior knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I know,&#8221; he said cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know no ill of him, and I will hear none. He is
Mademoiselle Gabrielle&#8217;s uncle and protecting friend,
and a good man.&#8221; Lucette&#8217;s tone was full of reproachful
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is miladi&#8217;s uncle, and a good man.&#8221; He
laughed again with the same unctuous suggestion of
intense enjoyment. &#8220;And all you people here in Malincourt
are so sharp and clever&mdash;so sharp and clever&mdash;as
clever as he is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are sharp enough to know an honest man when
we see him, and clever enough not to listen to the
tales of a maligner, Master Dauban,&#8221; retorted Lucette
with an appearance of great warmth. Her anger so delighted
the man that he threw himself into the seat
near her and laughed till his sides shook.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fools women are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a match for a man&#8217;s brilliant wits any
time,&#8221; cried Lucette very sharply. &#8220;Go away and
leave me in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A match for us! ho, ho! a match,&#8221; he laughed.
Presently he grew serious, leaned forward and said in
a lone tone: &#8220;You love miladi; you think my master
a good man, eh? What would you give to know what
I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know all the wickedness you know for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
a duke&#8217;s ransom,&#8221; declared Lucette sharply. &#8220;I should
have to hang myself if I did, in sheer self-shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pouf! women are worse than men; and you&#8217;re no
better than the rest, I&#8217;d be sworn. But you&#8217;re such a
pretty spitfire and say such waspish things; that&#8217;s what
I like in you. But for all your sharp tongue you are
as blind as a three-day kitten, and can&#8217;t tell milk from
vinegar when it&#8217;s under your very nose. You can&#8217;t
even smell it;&#8221; and he laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better a blind kitten than a wideawake rat with a
keen scent for garbage, Master Dauban,&#8221; she retorted
with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats can find other things than garbage, Mistress
Lucette. Shall I ask you a question?&#8221; He paused, and
then with an accent of great cunning, asked&mdash;&#8220;Why
do you think my good master is so interested in this
marriage of miladi with M. de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette laughed airily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to answer, of a surety. Because he is
the brother of Mistress Gabrielle&#8217;s late mother, and it
is a family affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There mewed the blind kitten,&#8221; he cried with another
of his triumphant laughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there squeaked a rat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does a good man like to see his niece, a pure
woman, mated with a scoundrel? Does he work and
scheme and strive and plot to force it on? Answer me
that, kitten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does even a rat seek to bite the hand that feeds
it? Answer me that, rat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feeds it? Out on such feeding,&#8221; he cried with sudden
malevolence. &#8220;Uses it, fools it, kicks it, and throws
a few husks to it, keeping all the grain for himself.
I know what I know, I tell you. And you should
know it too if you&mdash;but never mind. Go on with your
mewing, and when your gay gallant comes, set him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
on another pedestal as high as my noble master&#8217;s and
fawn on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What grudge have you against M. de Cobalt that
you would set us against him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grudge? I have no grudge. I have never even
set eyes on him. But I know what I know. And when
your eyes get opened, remember to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should a rat squeak against a man he
has never seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was quick to discern the earnestness which
Lucette allowed to appear in her tone; and he got up
and smiled cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a well to be emptied by a woman&#8217;s bucket,
Mistress Lucette. You will see, some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a word you&#8217;ve said,&#8221; she replied
with a shrug of indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could say much more if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;If what?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leered at her cunningly, and bending down close
to her shoulder, whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d give me such a kiss as I saw you give
Antoine de Cavannes in the wood yonder when Denys
St. Jean was at Courtal. &#8216;Splay-footed Antoine,&#8217; as
you called him to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette flushed with anger and vexation, genuine
enough now, and a passionate retort rose to her lips,
but did not pass them. She had to fight down her
anger in a pause which he mistook for confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have indeed both eyes and ears, Master
Dauban,&#8221; she answered with a quick glance of coquetry.
&#8220;But you will not tell on me?&#8221; she added, as if in dismay
and fear of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may,&#8221; he replied, enjoying her fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not. You must not.&#8221; Her accents were
those of quick alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love either of them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;A poor girl must have friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you would drive <i>me</i> away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Master Dauban, do you believe all a poor girl
says?&#8221; and she sighed and cast a languishing look on
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hate me and wish never to see me again. You
said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must every maiden wear her heart on her sleeve,
Master Dauban, for you handsome gallants to trifle
with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Jacques, by your leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the sweetest of names;&#8221; and Lucette sighed
and looked down; then started and dashed a look at
him and cried as if in distress&mdash;&#8220;Go away, Master
Dauban. You make me so&mdash;oh, I don&#8217;t know how to
say it. I feel&mdash;oh, do go away. You make me feel so
serious and so&mdash;so sad. Ah me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say those things to Denys and Antoine&mdash;and
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer Lucette fixed her eyes upon him reproachfully
and then sighed again; and her eyes could
speak in a language few men could read unmoved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you were cruel, but&mdash;oh, do leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand sought hers. She let him take it and returned
the pressure of his fingers, which trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never met <i>me</i> in the wood, Lucette,&#8221; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never asked me, Jacques. I never
thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she faltered and broke down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be there at set of sun this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I could not; I dare not. I could never do
that&mdash;but I often walk there&mdash;Jacques.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this evening?&#8221; He was trembling again in
his eagerness.</p>

<p>Her eyes said yes, the pressure of her tell-tale fingers
confirmed it, and the sigh she gave sent him into an
ecstasy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;I believe you do but play with poor me,&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear on my soul I am in earnest. I love you,
Lucette, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, not now, not now;&#8221; and she snatched her
hand quickly from him as if in great confusion and
picked up her spinning wheel. &#8220;I shall count the
minutes till the sun sets&mdash;<i>now</i>, Jacques,&#8221; she cried with
a bright laughing smile, and passed into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blind kittens are we, Master Rat?&#8221; she said to
herself as she went to her apartment. &#8220;If I do not
know all you have to tell me of this villainy against
Gabrielle before the dusk is dark, may I never know a
rogue when I see one.&#8221; And then her fears on Gabrielle&#8217;s
account having been excited, her quick wits
busied themselves with all manner of fanciful conjectures
as to what the vaguely shadowed danger could be;
and her impatience could scarce be held in check until
the time arrived for her meeting with Dauban.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the interview between Gabrielle and her
uncle had taken place and he had brought her news
which for the moment had both deeply interested and
greatly excited her.</p>

<p>The Baron de Proballe was a man whose aim in life
had been to fill to the brim the cup of self-indulgent
pleasures. Handsome, rich, unscrupulous and talented,
he was endowed with most of the vices except
cowardice, and while yet a young man he had soon made
himself a reputation as a profligate among profligates
until his excesses had ruined him. His fortune declined
as his reputation grew, and for some years he
had been driven to live upon his wits, which meant
trading upon his skill as a gambler until a particularly
disgraceful scandal had driven him from Paris, bankrupt
in pocket and much broken in health, to seek refuge
with his young kinswoman at Morvaix.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>There his evil fame was unknown, and Gabrielle had
welcomed him for her dead mother&#8217;s sake; and in the
small provincial city he had passed two hateful years,
brooding upon the pleasures which were now denied
to him and devising means to rehabilitate his shattered
fortunes and recover some of his lost health.</p>

<p>Outwardly he had hitherto shown himself a model
of a courteous gentleman and had lived almost an exemplary
life in Morvaix, having put away from him
with iron firmness the dissolute habits and evil practices
of the old life in Paris. The desire for them burnt as
strongly as ever in his blood, and his sole object in resisting
it so strenuously was the hope of regaining such
health, fortune and position as would enable him once
more to indulge them freely.</p>

<p>But there was a flaw in his plans which threatened
to ruin everything. He had ingratiated himself with
the Governor, and the Duke, as keen a gambler as
de Proballe himself, had won very heavy sums of money
which could not be paid; and he had in this way obtained
a hold over him which threatened to have critical
consequences to all concerned.</p>

<p>The Duke had acted with deliberate intention. A man
of reckless life and licentious nature, he had been
fascinated by Gabrielle de Malincourt&#8217;s beauty, and he
had formed a scheme in regard to her which made her
uncle&#8217;s assistance of the utmost value and consequence.</p>

<p>De Proballe himself, despite his evil past and seared
conscience, had at first refused indignantly to have any
hand in the vile matter; but the Governor, never nice
in his methods, had found means to over-ride this
opposition; and then de Proballe sought to justify his
act to himself by forming a counter-scheme against the
Governor.</p>

<p>To further the plan, Gabrielle&#8217;s uncle had concocted
the story and fabricated the proofs supporting it, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her parents&#8217; wish that she should marry a distant kinsman,
Gerard de Cobalt, a young reprobate whose life
had been if anything more disgraceful than that of de
Proballe himself. His culminating act of villainy had
been the treacherous murder of a friend at Cambrai, a
town within the Governor&#8217;s province, and for this he
was a fugitive from justice. De Cobalt&#8217;s reward for
his part in the infamous scheme was to be a pardon for
the affair at Cambrai; and he was to come to Morvaix
and marry Gabrielle to provide a complacent cloak for
the Governor&#8217;s scheme.</p>

<p>Gabrielle, suspecting nothing of the intrigue which
was in progress about her, and deceived by her uncle&#8217;s
consistently considerate and courteous demeanour to
herself, had grown both to trust and like him, and met
him now with a smile.</p>

<p>He noticed her disquiet and remarked on her troubled
looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the scene in the market place,&#8221; she said, and
told him what had occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there and saw it all, Gabrielle. I fear Babillon
brought it upon himself. We live in troubled times,
child, and authority must be maintained. The Duke is
hasty in temper, and he thought, I am sure, as did I and
others, that the smith meant to attack him. It is only
in the first moments of an outbreak that it can be quelled;
had this gone further much more blood than the smith&#8217;s
would have been shed. Remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was but protesting,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He nearly killed two of the soldiery with his protest,
child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until they were ordered to attack him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who raises his hand in violence must look for
violence in return. I am not defending the act. Had
I been Governor I would have listened first and punished
afterwards, but that is not de Rochelle&#8217;s method.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;It was a foul murder, and I care not who hears
me say it,&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle vehemently. &#8220;And this
infamous tax caused it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is about that I have news for you. The Duke
is considering your request to him and will wait upon
you here at Malincourt, to-morrow. He is a staunch
friend to you, Gabrielle, and your lightest word has
weight with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should need no one&#8217;s word to induce him to do
justly,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He grinds the face of the people
with his hideous tyranny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have this influence with him and can best
use it in the people&#8217;s cause. That is a great thought for
you to ponder. You will not do best for them by incensing
it, but rather by leading him to see these things
as you see them.&#8221; He watched her very closely as he
said this in his gentlest and most persuasive tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I despise him,&#8221; she said with a shudder. &#8220;I
loathe him, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In this world we cannot choose the means we would,
but must use those which lie to our hands. Yours is
a heavy load of responsibility for such young shoulders
to bear, my child. The head of a great house, alone
with none to advise save an unworthy old man who has
wearied of the affairs of the world, and with the cares
of an army of suffering people to plague and oppress
you. Let us hope that your marriage will prove the
relief it should. Gerard de Cobalt should be here to-day
or to-morrow. Pray Heaven he carries a steady head
on worthy shoulders&mdash;as indeed I hear he does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle sighed and lifted and let fall her hand; a
half-despairing gesture suggestive of her distracted
thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should be all smiles, Gabrielle. My dear sister,
your mother, and your father, too, built so much
upon this marriage. The Governor also is profoundly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
interested in it, and will welcome your husband and
give him an honoured place in his favour and esteem.
You two are destined to do great things for Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please God it may be so,&#8221; returned Gabrielle earnestly.
&#8220;But to take a husband I have never seen is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
The sentence ended in another gesture as hopeless as the
first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made many searching inquiries concerning
him, Gabrielle. A handsome gallant and as brave and
fearless as comely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be for the best,&#8221; she said lifelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must and will be for the best,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;To-morrow
you will hear from the Duke how he proposes
to honour the man of your choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Choice?&#8221; echoed Gabrielle, catching at the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, choice; what else? Whom else in Morvaix
would you choose? You would not choose to disobey
your dear mother&#8217;s last earthly wish. And the obligations
of a girl placed as you are at the head of a house
such as ours might well have compelled a marriage
with a far less welcome groom. I could tell you of
scores of such ill-fated unions. Keep a light heart,
child; for you may face the future fearlessly&mdash;a brilliant
future too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am foolish and rebellious at times, I know. But
I am not unmindful of my duty to my house,&#8221; she said
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a Malincourt; like my sainted sister&#8217;s
own child. Keep that face for the Governor to-morrow,
Gabrielle. Smile to him and upon him, and the rule
of Morvaix and all in it will be inspired by your gentle
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that thought he deemed it judicious to end
the interview.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE DUKE&#8217;S PROPOSAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was one very bitter heart in the maison
on the following morning. Jacques Dauban had
spent a bad night, groaning over aching bones
and head, brooding over his wrongs and setting his
cunning wits to work to devise a scheme of revenge.</p>

<p>Very ill results had followed that meeting with Lucette
in the pine-walk. She had kept the tryst and had
wheedled out of him a part of what he knew. He had
not told her much; only warned her to do her utmost
to prevent the marriage between Gabrielle and Gerard
de Cobalt, hinting at dark deeds of which he dared not
speak, and denouncing Gerard as both an unscrupulous
scoundrel and a tool in the hands of others greater and
more villainous even than he.</p>

<p>She might have got more from him, but it chanced
that Denys St. Jean had also conceived a fancy for a
stroll in the wood, and had come suddenly upon the
pair in close and intimate talk. His quick temper had
fired instantly, and the consequences to Jacques Dauban
had been serious. Denys was strong in the arm, and his
cudgel, snatched hastily from a tree, thick and heavy;
and there was scarcely a bone in the writhing, wriggling
spy&#8217;s body which did not ache and stab and pain.</p>

<p>And Lucette had laughed.</p>

<p>The laugh was the worst of all. It was in his ears
all through the paining hours of the night; maddening
him, taunting him, and goading him almost to a frenzy
of wrath and spite. He read it as the proof that she
had fooled him; that she had laid the trap to bring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
hot-headed devil upon him; and had planned his
humiliation and beating.</p>

<p>He would be revenged; and as he twisted and turned
and groaned in an anguish of mind even more than of
body, a scheme came to him; and in the congenial task
of working it out and maturing it, his own sufferings
were more than half forgotten.</p>

<p>His first thought had been to lay in wait for Denys
and, catching him unawares, to thrust a dagger between
his ribs swiftly from behind; but there was too much
risk. He might fail to strike true, and then&mdash;the horrible
fear of what would happen to himself in such a
case killed the plan at once.</p>

<p>The next thought was to hire some one in Morvaix
to do what he with his own hand was afraid to attempt,
but his cunning made him hesitate to place himself in
any other&#8217;s power. And so that idea had in its turn to
be abandoned.</p>

<p>But out of it had come the scheme which he saw was
at once safe and sure. He would remain in the background
all unsuspected even by Lucette, and might
mask his work in any way he wished; and yet Denys
would die as surely as if his was the hand which plunged
the dagger home to his heart. Aye, much more surely.</p>

<p>He would tell the Baron de Proballe that Denys had
in some way got scent of the scheme which had been
laid against Gabrielle and that he meant to divulge it
to her.</p>

<p>He had some ground to believe this, moreover. Earlier
in the day Denys had put some searching questions to
him, had hinted at ugly rumours, and asked significantly
about strange letters which had passed between
de Cobalt and his master. And Dauban knew the latter
well enough to be sure what would happen. The Baron
would tell the Duke, and the tiger of a Governor would
find means to silence Denys for ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>And when Denys was dead, he would tell Lucette
that it was his hand that secretly had killed him; and
that mocking laugh of hers would change to a gasp of
fear of him. That would be something like a revenge,
and he gloated in fancy over the picture of Lucette&#8217;s fear-stricken
face when she knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her laugh then, if she can,&#8221; he said to himself;
and when the hour came for him to go to his master, he
had his tale ready and told it artfully with a hundred
touches which all calculated to appeal to de Proballe&#8217;s
imagination and spur his alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;How know you this, Jacques?&#8221; asked de Proballe,
when he had heard the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;I overheard him last night speaking to Mademoiselle
Lucette and saying he had grave news which he must
tell miladi at once about M. de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may not mean what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear that it did, m&#8217;sieu. The two are lovers, it
seems, and like a woman she was trying to wheedle the
facts out of him. He was loath to tell her and sought
to put her off; but she got something from him. He said
M. de Cobalt was a scoundrel&mdash;he has a scurrilous tongue
this Denys&mdash;and, saving your presence, m&#8217;sieu, he said
that de Cobalt was but a tool in the hands of greater
scoundrels. Shamed I am that my lips should have to
speak the words, but your lordship must know the truth&mdash;he
named you and His Grace the Duke de Rochelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the devil&#8217;s name, this is serious then,&#8221; exclaimed
de Proballe angrily. &#8220;How much does he know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, m&#8217;sieu, I cannot say. He hinted at an intercepted
letter, but he was called away soon. I can
only infer he has made an important discovery. But the
girl was terribly alarmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may ruin everything. Have you breathed a whisper
to a soul?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I served you all these years to betray you?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and he spread his hands out and spoke as if in sorrow
that such a suspicion should even be named. &#8220;That she
suspects something I know to be true indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me. Quick, Jacques, I am uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Purposefully I put myself in her way, m&#8217;sieu. She is
a pretty girl enough and thinks, forsooth, that all men
can be wheedled by her glances. She led round artfully
to the subject and plied me with questions, all inspired,
as I could see, by what this Denys had told her. She
did not find me easy to draw, m&#8217;sieu,&#8221; and he smiled with
deprecating reference to his secrecy. &#8220;But &#8217;twas easy
to see what was in her thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may also be a source of danger. She may tell
Gabrielle,&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe quickly. &#8220;By Heaven;
the thing must be stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not Dauban&#8217;s wish to have Lucette harmed,
so he made haste to check this thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of herself she knows nothing, m&#8217;sieu; all hangs on
the man&#8217;s story, and if both of them were removed from
Malincourt, might not miladi herself take fright?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shrewd thought, Jacques. We must deal with the
man alone. Do you think he can have seen my niece
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, m&#8217;sieu, I am sure. I watched him closely. But
this morning he may seek her&mdash;nay, he will do so. He
said as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must not,&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe earnestly. &#8220;At
any cost that must be prevented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be difficult, m&#8217;sieu, but should not be impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a thought, I see. Speak it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for me to offer counsel to you, m&#8217;sieu. But
yesterday there was a cavalier who afforded some assistance
to miladi in the market place. She is anxious to
find him, and sent this Denys yesterday in search of him.
If you could have knowledge that the stranger was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
be found, say at some place a few leagues away, it
might be possible to despatch Denys thither in quest of
him, and thus enable time and perchance provide means
and opportunity to deal with him. Miladi would appreciate
any effort to find the cavalier, and some of the
roads around Morvaix are not over-safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a cunning brain, Jacques,&#8221; exclaimed de
Proballe suddenly, with a sharp glance at his secretary.
&#8220;Have you aught against this Denys?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dauban did not shrink from the scrutiny, but answered
deferentially&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my lord thinks I should place my feelings before
my duty to him, I have served him uselessly all these
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it, Jacques. You too well know on
which side your interest lies, and you know also that I
should not be a pleasant man to betray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am naught if not your faithful servant, my lord,&#8221;
replied Dauban. He knew he had said enough for his
purpose and that his master would adopt the suggestion
he had let fall. The seed he had sown would bear fruit;
and he was astute enough not to appear too anxious and
thus reveal his personal feelings.</p>

<p>His plan was carried out. De Proballe sent for Denys,
and after inquiring about the guest of the previous day
he said he had news that the cavalier could be found at
Beaucamp, an estate some four leagues west of Morvaix.
He expressed his desire to please and surprise
Gabrielle by finding the stranger, and also spoke feelingly
about the honour of the family being concerned to
thank the stranger for the service rendered to its young
head, and thus despatched Denys on the mission before
he could get a word with Gabrielle.</p>

<p>As soon as he had seen him start, he hurried with his
news to the castle, had an earnest interview with the
Duke, and returned to Malincourt without Gabrielle even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
knowing of his absence. Thus the train was all laid
when at noon the Governor, in accordance with the arrangement
of the previous day, came to wait upon Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made all arrangements?&#8221; was de Proballe&#8217;s
greeting when they met for a moment and were going
to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely to fail, m&#8217;sieu,&#8221; was the drily-spoken
reply. &#8220;Antoine de Cavannes and Henri d&#8217;Estelle have
ridden out, and know me better than to return with any
mission unfulfilled. My men serve me well or do not
serve me long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next minute he was bowing over Gabrielle&#8217;s hand,
which he would have carried to his lips had she not
adroitly and with unseeming intention prevented him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun never shines for me, mademoiselle, when I
have no chance to look into your eyes,&#8221; he murmured,
with glances of bold, almost aggressive admiration.</p>

<p>Words and glance were alike detestable to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship is pleased to flatter, but flattery does
not please me,&#8221; she returned with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no flattery, but the truth,&#8221; he protested, his
hand on his heart. &#8220;Your beauty is the fairest thing
the earth holds for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The good opinion of the husband of my dear friend,
the Duchess de Rochelle, must of course be ever welcome,
but I beg you to burden it with less wealth of
language.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the reference to his wife the Duke frowned, as
he took a seat near her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We see too little of you, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said next,
&#8220;and rumour says you are often to be found in many
of the humble houses in Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! my lord, there is much distress and poverty
among the people, and Holy Church requires that those
who can should minister to them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Holy Church should do the work more thoroughly.
I hold not with this constant tending and pampering of
those whose chief employment seems to be to breed discontent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have unhappily but too much cause for discontent,&#8221;
said Gabrielle firmly. &#8220;You have considered the
petition which I ventured to send to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know of these things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own eyes have seen their distress, their want,
their sufferings. Men workless and despairing, women
hopeless and languishing, children starving and crying
for the food which the parents cannot give them. We
who are rich and have plenty can but scantily measure
the pain of those in want. Even when we see it for ourselves
we cannot realize all its misery; and those of us
who never see it cannot even believe in its existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have me don a monk&#8217;s garb, then, and
turn bread carrier to a set of worthless wastrels?&#8221; asked
the Governor half in anger, half in sardonic humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, my lord, it is in no such spirit I would approach
you. But you have the power to administer relief
which all others lack. I would but have you recognize
the evil and apply the remedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a beautiful advocate, Mistress Gabrielle,
and you, if anyone, can work your will with me. I
would gladly see these things with your eyes&mdash;to please
you,&#8221; he said with a meaning glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am but of small account, and to please me is a very
little thing, and at best a poor motive for doing right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be <i>my</i> only motive, poor or rich. But I fear
you understand the art of government but ill. We must
have money to administer the town. We must have
troops, and troops must be paid and fed, fair advocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Is force in the hand of the ruler a surer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
foundation of rule than content and prosperity among
the ruled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world cannot wag without soldiers, mademoiselle,
and Morvaix can only be ruled by force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must a populace be starved that the soldiers may
be fat? If I seem to speak boldly, it is because I feel
deeply. And if I offend, I crave your pardon, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing you could say or do could ever offend me,
Mademoiselle Gabrielle. With you I am as clay in the
hands of the potter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, if you put it merely on grounds personal to
myself, I can urge nothing,&#8221; said Gabrielle, sadly and
reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet they are the only grounds that will prevail with
me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;The lot of these people is much to
you, you say; then you would of a surety make sacrifices
to help them? Is it not so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do anything in my power,&#8221; she said warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be proved,&#8221; he retorted, smiling as
he looked searchingly at her. &#8220;Perhaps I may take
that as a challenge and put you to a test. Your petition
here&#8221;&mdash;he drew it out and opened it. &#8220;You urge me
to recall this last ordinance of mine and take off the new
imposts on food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people will starve if you do not, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let them starve, then. I must have money, and
money can only be raised by such means. But if I were
to grant you this favour, make this sacrifice for you,
what sacrifice would you make in your turn, what favour
would you grant me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were glowing as he turned them upon her
while waiting for her reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand your lordship,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
meeting his glance with her calm innocent gaze.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Or is it that you will not?&#8221; he asked insolently.
&#8220;Supposing I agree that your influence shall prevail
with me and that in the government of Morvaix you and
I shall act together: you inspiring with your lofty motives,
I executing with the powers at my command. If
we try it for a year, two years, three years&mdash;any time
you like to fix&mdash;what would be my reward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rich gratitude of a contented people, the respect
of every man in Morvaix; hope in place of despair,
prosperity instead of want, love where fear now lurks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! I do not seek the love of such canaille, a
mouthing mob as ready to shout &#8216;Crucify&#8217; as &#8216;Hosanna!&#8217;
What reward would you yourself grant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should for ever bless and admire you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For ever is a long, indefinite time, and blessings and
admiration may be but cold emotions. What would you
<i>do</i>?&#8221; and he once more fixed his bold eyes upon her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I say I do not understand what your lordship
would have me say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused in thought and then laughed abruptly, almost
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is enough,&#8221; he exclaimed, with a wave of the
hand. &#8220;The thought pleases me, for I would gladly
please you; believe that I will grant your petition&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thank you&mdash;&#8221; she burst in, when he checked
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait. I will grant it if you will fall in with my
plan, will lend me your aid in the perilous task of government;
will work with me and inspire me with your
sweet counsel; and if you will consider what favour you
will grant me in return. I will have my answer in a
week from now, and until then we speak no more of
this. Now I have to offer you my congratulations upon
your approaching marriage, in which I take deep interest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>He rose shortly afterwards, and when Gabrielle held
her hand to him he carried it to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said, retaining her hand and looking
up, his face quite close to hers. &#8220;Remember, we
have made a compact, and you must make the offer
worthy of my acceptance&mdash;or it may mean fresh and
heavier imposts for your favourites in place of lighter
ones,&#8221; and with that smiling, half-jesting menace he
went away, calling the Baron de Proballe to attend him.</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood gazing after him sorely bewildered by
what had passed, distracted by doubts and striving earnestly
to fathom the meaning of the question he had
pressed with such insistence.</p>

<p>When he had gone she went to an inner room, accompanied
by Lucette who had been present at the interview
but out of earshot, and had followed the strange proceedings,
watching the Duke intently and reading there something
of the purpose which was hidden from Gabrielle&#8217;s
unsuspecting nature.</p>

<p>Lucette was skilled in reading love in the eyes of men,
and with quaking heart and fearsome curiosity she
waited now to hear what words the Duke had spoken to
Gabrielle to inspire the looks which she had seen him
cast upon her. And when she heard them, Lucette felt
her cheeks alternately flame with rage and chill with
deadly fear for Gabrielle&#8217;s sake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE TIGER&#8217;S CLAWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LUCETTE had had her own troubles as well.
Never before had such a mischance occurred as
that of the previous evening in the pine-walk;
and the fact that she was merely tricking Dauban in
order to wheedle the truth out of him had not helped
her with her lover in the least.</p>

<p>The thrashing administered to Dauban had relieved
some of Denys&#8217; wrath; but the hard blows for him had
been followed by some equally hard words for Lucette,
with many hot and bitter reproaches: none the less
stinging because for once undeserved. And she had not
been able to make peace with him.</p>

<p>Worst of all, he had ridden away that morning without
so much as a word to her; and she was angry at his
obduracy and wounded by his neglect, and still more
angry with herself for caring so much.</p>

<p>Gabrielle, quick to notice the troubles of those about
her, had seen Lucette&#8217;s woe-begone, doleful looks and
questioned her before the Duke&#8217;s visit; but now for the
moment she was wholly engrossed by the perplexity in
which that visit had left her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can he want of me, Lucette?&#8221; she asked again
and again, until Lucette had a suggestion to make, born
of her own belief of the Duke&#8217;s purpose and intended as
a warning for Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not take counsel of the Duchess? She is a true
friend of yours, Gabrielle, and a good woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good thought. I will go to her to-day. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
would give half my wealth to do what he proposes&mdash;to
have a voice even for no more than a few short years
in governing the people. I could do so much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he keep his word, think you? I do not trust
him. Truth and honour are not counted among his
parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are suspicious. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To begin with, he is a man,&#8221; and Lucette nodded her
head and stamped her foot petulantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always a quick path to your disfavour, coz,&#8221;
said Gabrielle with a smile. &#8220;Denys is a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys has a head of wood,&#8221; said Lucette, lapsing
into her own wrongs for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing the infinite uses to which we turn wood, I
know not why we always liken it to stupidity. Whatever
our good Denys&#8217; head may be, his heart is staunch and
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not speaking of Denys but of the Duke, who
has neither wooden head nor staunch heart&mdash;unless it
be staunch to some cruel and treacherous purpose for his
own game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear there is truth in your words; yet he spoke me
fairly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any man can do that,&#8221; exclaimed Lucette, with almost
vicious emphasis. &#8220;But see the Duchess herself,
tell her all that passed, and ask her. A wife should certainly
know best how to interpret her husband&#8217;s words.&#8221;</p>

<p>The advice was given with so much eagerness that
Gabrielle turned and looked searchingly into her friend&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you made a guess at his purpose and withhold
it from me?&#8221; She asked so directly that Lucette winced,
fearing that her own fears might be divined. She took
shelter quickly in subterfuge, and lowering her eyes she
dropped her head on Gabrielle&#8217;s shoulder and said with
a deep sigh&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;WHAT A THING OF APRIL WEATHER, IS THIS LOVE<br />
OF YOURS, LUCETTE&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;Oh, Gabrielle, I am not myself; I am the most
miserable girl on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a thing of April weather is this love of yours!
Smiles and tears, sunshine and drifting clouds; ever
changing and plaguing, as it seems to me, coz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will know some day, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could hope not, indeed. It seems to me the world
has sterner work for some of us women than to be
plaguing our wits to please a man or pleasing ourselves
by plaguing him. I would gladly give up all if I could
help my people in Morvaix here. Little did the Duke
think how nearly his offer touched me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think so sternly yesterday, Gabrielle, after
that chance encounter in the market place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my thoughts wandered from my duty for an hour,
a night&#8217;s reflection has corrected them,&#8221; answered Gabrielle
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The night had nothing but bitterness for me,&#8221; cried
Lucette dismally. &#8220;And to-day Denys has ridden away
without a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not provoke his anger against you so
lightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no cause for it. He would be jealous of
another man&#8217;s shadow,&#8221; said Lucette with a pout; and
then with a quick change of mood, she cried: &#8220;Oh, how
selfish I am; but how am I to tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell me what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what name to give it, or how to speak
of it. I was talking with Master Dauban, your uncle&#8217;s
secretary&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that was the cause of Denys&#8217; anger! Lucette,
Lucette!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate him; he is a loathsome creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why talk to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made me talk to him by what he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now of a truth you puzzle me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;It is true. He spoke of some danger threatening
Malincourt and you, and I did but try to get it from him.
That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not listen to tittle-tattle, coz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He spoke of your betrothal to this M. de Cobalt&mdash;that
there was some sinister meaning in it; that M. de
Cobalt was no true man but a villain; and that others
greater than he were concerned to do you harm through
him. What could I do but listen and seek the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have bid him hold his tongue for a mischief-making
meddler in concerns that are none of his.
Tell me no more of it, Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he swore it was true, and that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, child; I will hear no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, you must,&#8221; cried Lucette, looking up. &#8220;It
is true, and you must find out what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I give my hand to a man not trusting him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you marry him knowing he is not true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette, you will make me lose patience. Would you
have me deign to fret myself over the worrying of an
idle gossip-monger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not yourself, child, and are frightened because
you have angered Denys more deeply than usual.
Come, let us go out into the bright sunshine and shake
off these fretting fancies. You are always the slave of
passing moods, Lucette,&#8221; she said, as they crossed the
terrace and passed down the broad steps into the garden.
&#8220;But out here in the sunshine you can most easily
recover your spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am plagued with a fear of&mdash;I know not what,&#8221; answered
Lucette, sighing dismally. &#8220;I wonder where
Denys has gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come back, and as you are always telling
me, all will come right, again.&#8221; She smiled but the smile
ended in something like a sigh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>She was indeed sorely perplexed by the course matters
were taking, and although she would not acknowledge
it, Lucette&#8217;s recital of Dauban&#8217;s warning had
moved her considerably.</p>

<p>It fitted closely with her own feelings in regard to giving
herself to a man she had never seen. Her pride of
place and family had alone induced her to think of accepting
the husband whom her mother had chosen for
her; but it was not in human nature to acquiesce without
murmurs and qualms and doubts and hesitation.</p>

<p>Moreover, the scene in the market place on the previous
day had disturbed her profoundly, despite her stout assertion
that the night&#8217;s reflection had restored her. Her
couch had been the ground of a fierce battle between certain
wild new-springing emotions and the set and sober
thoughts of duty; and the fight had raged through the
whole of a sleepless night.</p>

<p>In vain she had told herself over and over again that
the stranger cavalier was nothing to her and could be
nothing; that it was treachery to her dead mother even
to let a thought of him force itself upon her; that it was
unworthy, unmaidenly, and cowardly to be moved by
the remembrance that a man had looked kindly into her
eyes and that she had faltered before his glance; and
this at the very moment when he to whom she was betrothed
was coming to her.</p>

<p>She upbraided herself bitterly for her weakness, and
rising from her couch had passed an hour or more on
her knees in fervent prayer for strength to overcome the
temptation which she found so alluring, and for power
to subdue these new feelings as subtly sweet as they were
strange and exciting.</p>

<p>Her heart would not be denied, however, and despite
her most resolute efforts the recollection of the strong
handsome face, with the clear steadfast blue eyes would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
force itself back upon her again and again and yet again,
despite her most earnest efforts.</p>

<p>In the morning when her uncle told her that he had
heard of the stranger&#8217;s presence at Beaucamp and had
despatched Denys in search of him, she was conscious
that her heart fluttered almost wildly for the moment,
and she had been compelled to turn her face away lest
some of the emotion might make itself evident there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must not think us thankless, uncle,&#8221; she had replied,
calmly enough in tone; but in her heart she was
driven to hope he would not be found and that never
would she have to undergo the ordeal of meeting him
face to face. What might then happen she did not dare
to think.</p>

<p>But all this emotion she had hidden from even the
sharp eyes of her companion, so that, although for her
own secret reasons she was as eagerly impatient as
Lucette herself for Denys&#8217; return, her secret was locked
away under an outward demeanour as calm and self-possessed
as usual.</p>

<p>Twice she sent to inquire if he had come; pretending,
even while despising herself for the pretence, that it was
for Lucette&#8217;s sake; and when noon came and passed and
he had not returned, she masked her own disappointment
under a concern for Lucette.</p>

<p>But he did return at length, despite the Duke&#8217;s plans
against him. Unconscious of the danger in which he
rode he had by a mere chance change of direction evaded
the two men sent to waylay him, and they had only ascertained
the fact in time to admit of their following him
to Malincourt in hot haste and mortal fear of the Governor&#8217;s
anger.</p>

<p>They had wandered into a distant part of the grounds
when Gabrielle caught sight of him pricking fast toward
the maison, and she was at great pains to conceal the
start she gave on seeing he was alone. She told herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that she was glad he brought no one with him; but a
little stinging stab of disappointment deep down in her
heart and an eager, hungry desire to learn the news he
brought, told a very different story.</p>

<p>Then Lucette caught sight of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Gabrielle, look. There rides Denys,&#8221; she cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Gabrielle in a calm tone, feeling like
a wicked hypocrite for her small pretence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there. I hope he will not see us,&#8221; exclaimed
Lucette, pointing in his direction and making herself as
conspicuous as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are showing yourself plainly, Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he will know where not to come, if he is not
in a better temper than this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denys had seen Lucette. Gabrielle saw him turn and
look toward them and then ride on toward the house
without making a sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might have waved a hand,&#8221; said Lucette, pouting
and shrugging her shoulders. &#8220;But I will punish him.
Let us go away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just now you implied that he would not come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not forgive him easily if he does,&#8221; said Lucette,
with a shake of the head and a little stamp of the foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will leave you to meet him, coz; and take my advice,
cease to play this foolish game with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two other cavaliers riding this way,&#8221; said
Lucette suddenly, &#8220;and spurring hard in urgent haste,
it would seem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had they not been so intent in watching these and
speaking of Denys, they would have seen yet another
cavalier who stepped for a moment from a belt of trees,
looked eagerly in their direction, and then hurriedly hid
himself.</p>

<p>Gabrielle, quite unconscious of this, continued to urge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Lucette to wait alone for Denys and seek to make her
peace with him. But Lucette was obstinate; and when
at length she caught sight of Denys in the distance,
dust-stained with his long ride, walking in their direction,
she drew Gabrielle hurriedly behind a clump of trees
into hiding.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see what he does,&#8221; she whispered excitedly.
&#8220;I shall know by his face what mood he is in.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Denys reached the spot where they had been
he paused and looked about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was here I saw her, I&#8217;ll swear,&#8221; he said aloud to
himself. &#8220;I marked that old chestnut tree,&#8221; and he
glanced at it. &#8220;Which way can she have gone? Lucette,&#8221;
he called in a loud voice. &#8220;Lucette.&#8221; As he
looked about him he backed close to the low trees behind
which the two girls stood. &#8220;She can&#8217;t have wandered
far. Lucette&mdash;Lucette,&#8221; he called again, and waited
for his voice to come echoing back.</p>

<p>Then Lucette, whose face had brightened at hearing
him call for her, plucked a rose from her bosom and
tossed it so that it fell upon him in its course to the
ground. He picked it up and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rose from an almond tree,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;Surely
something of a strange portent. Where are you, Lucette;
little witch, that changes the natural blooms of a tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette had stepped on a low bough of a tree and
now looked through the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have dropped my rose, m&#8217;sieu. May I trouble you?
Ah, M. Denys, is it you?&#8221; with a start of pretended surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette,&#8221; he said passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; This distantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Lucette. Let the rose make our peace. I have
been thinking of you through all my long ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came slowly toward him, parting the bushes and
playing at indifference.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;It is my rose, if you please, m&#8217;sieu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you meant it for me,&#8221; and he kissed it and then
tried to take her hands. But she drew back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we know each other, m&#8217;sieu?&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was a smile and an attempt to take her
in his arms. But she would not let him. Seeing his
mood, she could not resist a chance to tease him further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten what you said last night? Did
you not ride off this morning without a word&mdash;a single
word? Do you think I forgive so easily, and forget?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer that, Denys,&#8221; said Gabrielle, stepping
out now from her place of concealment. She was
anxious to end the quarrel and learn the news he
brought. &#8220;She has forgiven you and is sorry for what
she did. She has been heart-broken all the morning at
your absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Lucette in protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, Denys, every word. So make your peace
with her. Come, Lucette, be true to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peacemaker as usual, mademoiselle,&#8221; cried Denys,
with a happy, grateful smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, indeed, it is nothing of the sort. Denys said
last night that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what I said in my anger, Lucette; I am
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was so causeless, so unjust, so&mdash;so horrible,&#8221;
and she put her hands to her ears as if in horror at the
mere recollection.</p>

<p>Denys captured them then in his strong hands and
held her a prisoner, while Gabrielle turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go, Denys, let me go; how dare you!&#8221; cried
Lucette, as if in anger, and commenced to struggle, tapping
her foot and averting her head as he strove to kiss
her. &#8220;Let me go I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till you say all that foolish quarrel is over, and
you have kissed me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;I will not. I will not. Let me go,&#8221; she cried, keeping
up the pretence of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. How dare you force me like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>And they were struggling in this way when a wholly
unexpected and unwelcome interruption came.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you treat a girl like that?&#8221; demanded a
man&#8217;s voice; and Antoine de Cavannes, followed by Henri
d&#8217;Estelle, who had dogged Denys&#8217; footsteps, rushed up
and laid violent hands on his shoulder. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you,
Lucette,&#8221; continued Antoine, in anger and surprise.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Denys frowned darkly. He released Lucette, who fell
back a step or two in disconcerted amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no concern of yours, gentlemen,&#8221; said Denys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, but it is. No cowardly cur shall maltreat a
girl in our presence, eh, d&#8217;Estelle?&#8221; The two men exchanged
meaning glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful of your words, m&#8217;sieu, if you please,&#8221;
said Denys, his hand going involuntarily to his sword-belt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful with a blackguardly girl-beater like you. Be
off about your business and leave mademoiselle with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; cried Denys under his breath. &#8220;You shall
eat those words, or I am no man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out on you for a braggart,&#8221; said Antoine, while his
companion gave Denys a violent thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be off with you, I say,&#8221; he exclaimed roughly.</p>

<p>In a moment Denys&#8217; sword was out of its scabbard.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Denys, you must not,&#8221; cried Lucette, now in
dire consternation at the turn matters had taken.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve often told me of this fellow&#8217;s blackguard
ways,&#8221; said Antoine. &#8220;It&#8217;s time he had a lesson how to
behave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, Gabrielle,&#8221; cried Lucette, catching sight
of her. &#8220;Come here. Come here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;Another petticoat for the coward to skulk behind,&#8221;
said d&#8217;Estelle, with a coarse laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, you have made a great mistake,&#8221; cried
Gabrielle, hastening forward. &#8220;This is not what you
think. M. St. Jean is betrothed to Mademoiselle de Boisdegarde.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It had small appearance of it just now,&#8221; said d&#8217;Estelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know it to be false,&#8221; declared Antoine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle, drawing herself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle!&#8221; answered d&#8217;Estelle, with insolent
imitation of her tone.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of d&#8217;Estelle&#8217;s mouth before
Denys strode forward and struck him a swinging
left-handed blow across the mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dog!&#8221; he said fiercely.</p>

<p>The two men drew then and were for attacking him
together, but Lucette threw herself before him. Her
wits, at first dazed by the dread of trouble to herself from
the meeting of Antoine and Denys, were now sharpened
by her fear for Denys&#8217; sake from the unequal combat,
and by a rapid intuition she jumped to the conclusion
that the meeting was designed for her lover&#8217;s hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall not be. It is not fair&mdash;two to one. You
cowards!&#8221; she cried, facing the couple angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand aside, Lucette,&#8221; said Denys, putting her away.
&#8220;The thing has gone too far,&#8221; and choosing a spot
which he deemed most to his advantage he put himself
in an attitude of defence. &#8220;Now, messieurs, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette wrung her hands distractedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will kill him. They have come to do it. I know&mdash;I
know,&#8221; she cried, until Gabrielle bade her run to the
house and get help, when she set off with the speed of
fear.</p>

<p>Denys was a good swordsman, and, having chosen his
ground well, fought warily against the pair, who, over-eager
to finish the thing before any help could come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
hampered each other, so that d&#8217;Estelle, getting in Antoine&#8217;s
way, tripped and fell. His sword flew out of
his hand and rolled close to Gabrielle, who instantly set
her foot upon it.</p>

<p>The man scrambled quickly to his feet and ran to his
sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not fair, monsieur, two to one,&#8221; said Gabrielle
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your foot from my sword, mademoiselle,&#8221; he
answered, a menace in both tone and look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; she answered as firmly as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take the consequences,&#8221; he cried fiercely, and
with a thrust he pushed her away, and snatching up his
weapon, ran to the assistance of Antoine, whom Denys
was now pressing fiercely in single combat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help, help!&#8221; called Gabrielle in a loud voice. &#8220;Will
no help come?&#8221;</p>

<p>But help was unexpectedly at hand, for another&#8217;s eyes
had seen the dastardly attack of d&#8217;Estelle.</p>

<p>The stranger who had been in the wood had witnessed
the last part of the quarrel, and when the two men commenced
the attack upon Denys, he had started at a rapid
run toward the scene.</p>

<p>A loud angry shout now proclaimed his arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;You villain, to strike a woman. Two swords to one,
gentlemen! This is murder, not fighting. Have a care,
monsieur; that rascal is getting behind your back. Ah,
a foul, treacherous stroke,&#8221; he exclaimed next, as
d&#8217;Estelle, having crept up behind Denys, ran his blade
into his back.</p>

<p>As Denys fell, the stranger gave another loud cry and
leapt forward. Antoine was about to deliver another
thrust while Denys lay on the ground, when his sword
was parried by that of the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;To me, messieurs, to me,&#8221; and the two men found
themselves the objects of a rapid and vehement attack by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
a swordsman vastly more skilful than themselves. In a
minute d&#8217;Estelle was wounded with a slash on the sword-arm,
and facing Antoine, the cavalier cried in a voice
of thunder: &#8220;Now, you assassin, it is your turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Antoine, deserted by his comrade, who ran off
as soon as he was wounded, had no heart to face the
blade which played round him, threatening death at
every flashing turn, gave ground and with a cry of terror,
broke away and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>His antagonist was following him, when there came a
cry from Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur&mdash;monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped at the words, turned, bared his head and
bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, mademoiselle. In my haste to punish
a treacherous coward I was forgetting you were alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur,&#8221; said Gabrielle, now lowering her eyes in
blushing confusion.</p>

<p>It was the cavalier who had rescued her the previous
day in the market place; and the rush of thoughts held
her tongue-tied in embarrassment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>&#8220;I AM KNOWN AS GERARD DE COBALT.&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GABRIELLE&#8217;S heart beat very fast in the few
moments she stood trying vainly to find words
to speak, and she was conscious of little save a
whirl of strange emotions in which predominated a sort
of guilty pleasure at meeting again the stranger who had
so filled her thoughts in the last hours.</p>

<p>He broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that scoundrel did not hurt you, mademoiselle?&#8221;
he said, voice and eyes alike full of solicitude,
as she noticed in her swift flitting upward glance when
he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur,&#8221; she replied, and could say no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have set a mark on him to know him by, and he
will have a reckoning to settle. By your leave, I will
see to this poor fellow&#8217;s hurt. I am something of a
surgeon. A soldier must be many things,&#8221; and with a
bow he went over to Denys and bent over him.</p>

<p>This act relieved Gabrielle&#8217;s embarrassment, and fear
for Denys made her less conscious of her own confusing
thoughts. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation she knelt down
on the other side of the wounded man.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor Denys,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>Her companion with quick deft touch found the wound,
and after examining it, staunched the blood which was
flowing freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;An ill sight for your eyes, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a soldier&#8217;s daughter, monsieur, and accustomed
to the treatment of the sick. Is the hurt serious, think
you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;To the best of my judgment, no, unless there be some
internal injury, which is not likely, judging by the direction
of the wound. It was a coward&#8217;s thrust in truth,
but like most coward&#8217;s work, ill done, thank Heaven. It
is mainly a flesh wound. But a surgeon should see it
with as little delay as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be help from the maison directly. I have
sent for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Denys opened his eyes and seeing
Gabrielle he smiled faintly, and then frowned in surprise
at her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not much hurt, my brave Denys,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
&#8220;and all is well with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denys rolled his eyes round as if in search of some one,
and Gabrielle was quick to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette has gone for help, Denys; she will be back
directly. All is well with her as with me.&#8221; He smiled
again, and making an ineffectual effort to speak, closed
his eyes with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Then footsteps and voices were heard, and Lucette, with
the Baron de Proballe and Jacques Dauban, came hurrying
to the spot. Lucette threw herself beside Denys while
de Proballe eyed the stranger with searching glances, and
started slightly at the sound of his voice as he bade
Lucette be cautious not to disturb Denys.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been fighting, I hear, Gabrielle,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been murder attempted, uncle, and it would
have been done but for the intervention of this gentleman,
who drove the assassins off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are deeply beholden to you, monsieur,&#8221; said de
Proballe courteously, &#8220;and on behalf of my niece, I thank
you.&#8221; While he spake he was searching his memory to
recall where he had seen the stranger, whose face and
voice he seemed to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need for thanks, monsieur,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;I did no more than any one would have done. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
wounded man should be removed and a surgeon should
see to his hurts. He has lost much blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will send for a litter. Run to the maison, Jacques,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your leave, and a little help in lifting him,
I could carry him if it be not too far,&#8221; interrupted the
stranger. And with Dauban&#8217;s and Lucette&#8217;s assistance,
he picked Denys up and bade them show him the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are strong, monsieur,&#8221; said de Proballe, with a
smile at the ease with which he bore the heavy burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a soldier, monsieur, and he who fights must
needs have strong arms. It were best if your servant
there were to run on and prepare for our coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dauban&#8217;s face scowled at the word servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run on, Jacques, and see to this,&#8221; said de Proballe,
adding: &#8220;He is my secretary, monsieur, not my servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dauban hastened on then, and Gabrielle and her uncle
walked in front, Lucette keeping by Denys.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the cavalier who came to my assistance in the
market place yesterday, uncle,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he? I am much mistaken if I have not seen
him somewhere before,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not inquired his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He belongs not to Morvaix, I think, and seems, as
you said, a man of some distinction. I will ask his name
and station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we not better wait until we reach the maison?
Our poor Denys is a heavy burden even for his stalwart
arms, and to cause him to talk just now might prove burdensome
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always solicitous, Gabrielle,&#8221; replied her
uncle, with a smile and a shrewd glance. &#8220;I will leave
it as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dauban had hurried on a prey to mingled
feelings, in which desire to appear anxious on Denys&#8217; behalf
and so hide his share in the matter was paramount.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
He sent one servant speeding on horseback for a surgeon
and brought out others with a litter, and met the little
procession as they were nearing the terrace.</p>

<p>Denys was laid carefully and gently on the litter and
borne up the broad steps into the house, Lucette walking
by his side and holding his hand.</p>

<p>The other three remained at the foot of the steps, the
stranger leaning for a space against one of the pediments
of the marble balustrade to recover his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be glad to know, monsieur, to whom we are
indebted for this most timely service as well as for that
rendered yesterday to my niece in the market place,&#8221; said
de Proballe. &#8220;It seems to me we have met before; but
I am getting an old man, and my memory is apt to fail
me at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question appeared to be momentarily embarrassing
and, to cover the pause, the stranger breathed heavily
and made a gesture of fatigue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come in and rest, monsieur,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
noticing this.</p>

<p>But the hesitation passed, and glancing first at Gabrielle
with a smile of thanks for her thoughtfulness, he turned
to de Proballe and said firmly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to have been of service to mademoiselle,
monsieur. I am known as Gerard de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard de Cobalt!&#8221; both exclaimed in a breath; de
Proballe adding &#8220;Our Gerard. Then of a truth are you
welcome indeed to Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Malincourt!&#8221; exclaimed Gerard, amazed at the
effect of the name he had given. He knew of course where
he was and who they were who spoke to him; but why
they should welcome him in this way passed his understanding.
And when he turned from de Proballe to
Gabrielle and saw that her cheeks were aglow with blushes
and her eyes bright and dancing with gladness, his bewilderment
was all the greater.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the work of Providence, surely,&#8221; she said, holding
her hand to him. He took it and pressed his lips to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, &#8217;tis Providence,&#8221; echoed de Proballe. &#8220;Now I
see why you were no stranger to me. &#8217;Tis the boy speaking
through the man, Gerard, and a right gallant man
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy?&#8221; asked Gerard, not understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. You were but a slip of a lad when we last
met, with little promise of being such a stalwart fellow.
But I will go and see to poor Denys. You two will not
be sorry to be alone and learn something each of the
other,&#8221; and with a sharp inscrutable glance at Gerard,
he passed up the steps and into the house.</p>

<p>Gerard felt profoundly ill at ease. It was clear that
some egregious mistake had been made concerning him,
and that he had been mistaken for some other Gerard
whose real name was that which he had assumed at random
for the purposes of his sojourn in Morvaix.</p>

<p>To avow himself Gerard de Bourbon, while his work
was still scarcely begun, was impracticable. It might
ruin everything indeed; for de Proballe would instantly
acquaint the Duke de Rochelle; yet to deceive the lovely
girl whose face had been in his thoughts from the moment
he had first seen her was repugnant to every sense
of right and instinct of honour.</p>

<p>There was another consideration. The Baron de Proballe
was represented as Gabrielle&#8217;s uncle; and knowing,
as Gerard did, the man&#8217;s real character and infinite
capacity for ill-doing, fears for Gabrielle herself impelled
him to maintain his assumed character until he had at
least satisfied himself that de Proballe had no evil intent
toward her.</p>

<p>He could not decide what to do for a moment, and his
confusion and hesitation were apparent to Gabrielle, who
set them down, however, to very different causes.</p>

<p>There was an alcove with a seat near the corner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the balustrade, and sinking upon it with a sigh, Gabrielle
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God you have come, cousin, and thank God
more that you are what you are, a brave and gallant
gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin?&#8221; echoed Gerard, catching the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin, of course; what else?&#8221; and then as if perceiving
some double meaning in her last words, she
blushed vividly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; he murmured, and then: &#8220;That
is the Baron de Proballe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, as surely as I am Gabrielle de Malincourt.
My uncle and my one good friend and adviser&mdash;up to
now.&#8221; She lifted her eyes and smiled as she emphasised
the last words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your good friend and adviser!&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;How oddly you speak, cousin. Is it not by his counsel
and urging that you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I am here?&#8221; he asked, this time with a start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are not glad to have been brought
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, I have seen you,&#8221; he answered with
a bow.</p>

<p>Gabrielle laughed gaily. &#8220;How formal, cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am lost in wonderment. I know not what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well that you are quicker with your sword than
with your tongue, or it would have gone harder than
it did with my poor Denys just now. But perhaps I
understand. You are surprised in me. I am different
from what you expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the fairest woman I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>She blushed again and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you could not look more scared were I the ugliest
witch. Shall I tell you a secret? I have dreaded your
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God I may never give you cause to repent it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
mademoiselle,&#8221; he replied with an intense earnestness
which drew her gaze full upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle?&#8221; she repeated, after a pause, with a
touch of coquetry. &#8220;Mademoiselle&mdash;from cousin to
cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>He started again uneasily, for the question put a fresh
puzzle to him&mdash;how to address her. Then he put it by and
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you dread my coming, as you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>She first winced and bit her lip, and then, setting her
head a little on one side, she glanced up at him with a
mischievous smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I once knew such a horrid Gerard de Cobalt; and if
you had been like him, oh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the sentence ended in a
shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, another Gerard de Cobalt?&#8221; he asked mystified.</p>

<p>She laughed outright then, merrily and without restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;As if you did not know. How could there be any
other Gerard de Cobalt but you? You were a horrid
boy, you know; really horrid; cruel, rough, unkind just
for unkindness&#8217; sake. And you used to hate me&mdash;at least
you said so; and I was glad of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have been worse than unkind&mdash;a fool, I think,
mademoiselle. Boys generally are,&#8221; he replied laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I say?&#8221; he asked, growing bolder the
deeper he allowed himself to plunge into the mystery, and
getting less and less willing to have it cleared up.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Gabrielle,&#8221; she said half shyly, &#8220;unless
you think mademoiselle prettier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle.&#8221; He spoke the name in a soft tender tone
with such a sweet reverence that she lowered her gaze
and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I was a horrid boy, was I?&#8221; he asked lightly,
breaking the pause. She looked up then all smiles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? But of course you didn&#8217;t think
so yourself, and I daresay thought me a little spitfire. You
used to pinch me slyly and kick me, and laugh when you
hurt me. I wonder I have not the bruises to this day.
And have you forgotten that time I flew at you and boxed
your ears?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder I can have forgotten,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you had snared a blackbird and were pulling
out its feathers, and mad at the sight I rushed at you and
struck you, and you let it go in your surprise. I hated
you for that, Gerard, I did indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Serve me right, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you called me such names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Gabrielle?&#8221; he interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and not mademoiselle,&#8221; she retorted laughing.
&#8220;But cat, and beast, and fury, and everything, and you
pulled my hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That hair?&#8221; he asked, laughing again. &#8220;What sacrilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, this hair,&#8221; she nodded gaily. &#8220;Oh, it is no
wonder that when they told me you were coming to&mdash;well,
you know why&mdash;that I was frightened lest you
should be just an older edition of that cruel little ugly
horror.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugly, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ugly. You were not a bit good-looking even for
a boy. I should never have guessed you were the same;&#8221;
and then she put her finger to her lip in some dismay
as if to check herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I am glad to have disappointed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think I have changed?&#8221; she asked, with
a challenge in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, in fifteen years? How strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it fifteen years since you saw that pleasant youth
you have described?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;Is that to put off my question? Have I disappointed
you as you have me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not even an idea of how beautiful you would
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, if you flatter me, I shall not like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no flattery&mdash;Gabrielle,&#8221; and the low earnest tone
thrilled her with delight. She thought a moment and
then, looking up, said simply as she smiled into his eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not unmaidenly, seeing why you have come to
Morvaix, for me to say what pleasure such words give
me, Gerard. Oh, I think I must be the happiest girl in
all fair France to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing why I have come?&#8221; he repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard!&#8221; The tone was one of reproach, and she
looked troubled. &#8220;You have come for&mdash;for a purpose,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; Her eyes were on the ground as she spoke
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and with God&#8217;s help, I will carry it through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up then, but the smile on her face faded
quickly away as she seemed not to read in his eyes what
she sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your purpose is&mdash;what?&#8221; she asked, in a strange
tone, very subdued, quiet and anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even to you I cannot tell it yet,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot tell it me, Gerard? But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she broke off
and repeated wonderingly: &#8220;&#8216;Cannot tell it me&mdash;yet?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you shall know it at the first moment I can open
my lips, and from what I have learnt of you, I know your
sympathy will be with me and it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle felt the colour leaving her cheeks. What
could he mean? There must be some hindrance to the
plan of their marriage. He had said nothing of this in
his letters to her uncle&mdash;nor a word to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have turned pale, mademoiselle. Are you ill?&#8221;
he asked kindly, seeing the change in her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;No, no; but I fear I don&#8217;t understand. I have been
unmaidenly and forward. But I did not know. You have
said nothing of this obstacle in your letters to my uncle
or to me. I thought it was settled. But I was wrong, of
course; we all have been. Yet I thought when you came
with no word&mdash;oh, cousin, was it manly or honourable
of you not to tell me at once, not to check me? Oh, I know
not what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was as much disturbed by the change in her as he
was troubled by the sight of her distress and puzzled by
her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obstacle? What obstacle? What have I said to disturb
you thus?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I would do anything in
the world for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shame me, cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, on my honour, I know not what you
mean?&#8221; he cried, with whole-hearted earnestness.</p>

<p>She rose then and looked at him, with a great effort
to be calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;As God is my judge, I would give my life to serve
you,&#8221; he protested passionately. &#8220;I repeat, I know not
what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What your purpose may be, I cannot guess; but matters
have gone too far for us to fence with words or feign
ignorance of facts. You can have had but the one purpose
in coming to Morvaix and to Malincourt. You have
already expressed it openly in your letters. It is to further
my dead parents&#8217; wish for our marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell back a pace in his intense wonderment, and
an exclamation of astonishment rushed to his lips only to
be checked with a supreme effort. But she saw the look
and noted the gesture, and her pride took instant offence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will leave you, monsieur; perhaps you will explain
this obstacle to my uncle with more candour than you
have deemed necessary to show to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>He conquered his surprise, and the wounded pride in
her eyes and voice roused him. To him she was more
than aught else in the world, and instantly he took the
resolve to sweep away the misunderstanding by explaining
all&mdash;his purpose in Morvaix, and that he was not the
man she believed. He could not let her go in anger, let
the cost be what it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment. As I live, there is no obstacle on my
side to&mdash;to our marriage. That I swear. But I will
explain all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and turned, her foot already on the steps
to leave him; and his heart leapt to see the light that his
words brought back to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have tried me sorely, cousin. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she faltered
and smiled and then leant for support against the balustrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows I would not cause you even a moment&#8217;s
uneasy thought,&#8221; he said earnestly. &#8220;I have done wrong,
I know, but the temptation was a sweet one. I had no
thought to deceive you when I came&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He got no farther, for at that moment de Proballe
stepped from the house and crossed the terrace to them,
saying cheerily as he approached&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, are you getting to know one another, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have to say is for your ears alone. I pray your
patience and will give you ample reasons,&#8221; said Gerard in
a quick undertone; adding aloud: &#8220;Yes, monsieur, we
are close to a complete understanding. Is it not so,
cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; she answered, mystified still, but smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Denys is better, but very weak, and is asking
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With your leave I will go to him,&#8221; she said to Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent her off that we may have a talk and an understanding,
too,&#8221; said de Proballe, when Gabrielle had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
into the house. &#8220;Let us walk here in the open where no
ears can catch our words.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way to where a fountain stood among the
flower beds surrounded by a broad path, and Gerard accompanied
him, in bewildered curiosity as to what this
new development was to be.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>AT MALINCOURT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DISTRESSED as Gerard had been by the necessity
to deceive Gabrielle, into which he had allowed
himself to be drawn, he had no such qualms in
regard to her uncle. He was convinced that, as Pascal
had said, if there was evil work on foot, de Proballe
would be concerned in it.</p>

<p>That such a man should be found established at Malincourt,
posing as the true friend of an innocent girl, and
regarded by her as an honourable and confidential adviser,
was in itself enough to rouse suspicion.</p>

<p>He decided at once, therefore, to fall in with de Proballe&#8217;s
mood, whatever it might be, and to lead him to
talk as freely as he would.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not come straight to Malincourt,
Gerard, or at any rate let me know of your presence in
Morvaix, that I might have word with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was doubtful of my reception by Gabrielle, can
you blame me?&#8221; asked Gerard in reply, dropping readily
into his assumed character.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I had told you exactly how matters were with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I had not seen her with my own eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Psh, a sentimental fool&#8217;s reason,&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, I am no sentimental fool, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were no worse, you would be lucky. Your
kinsman, Raouf, in Paris, gave me your history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have lied,&#8221; answered Gerard, calmly, suppressing
a start at the mention of the name and the coincidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
it suggested. &#8220;But let it pass. What I have done,
I have done. If it comes to that, Raouf gave me no
saintly account of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paris is not Morvaix, and what I do there or here is
no concern of yours or his,&#8221; was the curt, half angry reply.</p>

<p>Gerard laughed. &#8220;As I said, Raouf may have lied. It
is of no account; but I cannot see that in choosing my own
method I have done so ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe smiled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You played boldly. I did not know you had such
courage&mdash;except in your cups. Yes, you have made a
good impression on Gabrielle; but have none the less
done ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In saving that fool to-day. You were too hasty. You
should have let one of the swords find his heart, and then
have played the rescuer of Gabrielle. The men wouldn&#8217;t
have touched you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Gerard quickly. &#8220;They tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you stood between them and Denys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Read me the riddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys has found out something of the real purpose
of this marriage; how much I know not; and his silence
is necessary to our success. The Duke will not thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke!&#8221; exclaimed Gerard hastily, bewildered by
this unexpected reference to the Governor in connection
with the marriage. A sudden sharp glance from his companion
warned him that he had blundered, so he forced
a laugh, and added: &#8220;The Duke should label his men if
he does not want them hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a fool?&#8221; retorted de Proballe, sharply.
&#8220;Had you come straight to me, this would have been
avoided. I tell you the man is dangerous. Is not that
enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it depends on how much he knows.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;He knows that you are here to marry Gabrielle and
that in doing so you are merely playing catspaw; and
he suspects the real purpose, that it is to cover the Duke&#8217;s
plan in regard to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he suspects what an infernal villain Gerard de
Cobalt must be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not alone in that suspicion,&#8221; was de Proballe&#8217;s
sneering comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. I think I&#8217;m beginning to suspect it myself,&#8221;
answered Gerard drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were anything else, you&#8217;d be little use to us;
so let us have no cant here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here to play my part,&#8221; said Gerard smoothly,
repressing his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a part many a better man would gladly play.
You will have wealth, a beautiful wife, a high position
here, and a pardon for that Cambrai affair. Surely all
that a man could wish.&#8221; He regarded Gerard with a sly
covert smile as he reeled off these advantages.</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s face was as impassive as that of a statue,
while his thoughts were busy seeking the real meaning
beneath the words. He paused a moment, and then answered
in a level tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but you omit the price I have to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Price,&#8221; cried de Proballe, with another sneer.
&#8220;Price! Honour rather, you mean. The Duke de
Rochelle is all but of the Royal blood; and better men
than you will ever be have been glad to pay no more for
their careers than mere marital complaisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; exclaimed Gerard, his voice vibrating with
feeling as he realized now the full infamy of the plot and
the degradation of the part cast for him; then catching
de Proballe&#8217;s eyes fixed on him, he forced down his rage,
and said coolly: &#8220;You are right, monsieur; Gerard de
Cobalt cannot afford to be particular. He has that pardon
to gain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;Now perhaps you understand the harm you did in
saving that meddler&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see now that if I had had all these thoughts in my
mind I would have acted differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see the Duke to-day, and will find him in
a gracious mood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not the reputation he bears. They call him the
Tiger, I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His enemies do; those who seek to thwart him. He
saw Gabrielle to-day, and what passed between them
pleased him greatly. She urged him to relax the rigour
of his rule here; and he half consented. His plan is that
he and she shall take frequent counsel together for the
government of the people&mdash;when she is your wife. He
will thus see much of her in many a private conference,
and the people will have cause to bless her name for her
good influence. Some of the blessings may come your
way, Gerard, for the good change will date from the
time of your marriage. You will be a popular man in
Morvaix.&#8221; He ended with another of his dry cynical
laughs, and looked for his companion to join in.</p>

<p>But Gerard was too deeply moved even to simulate
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is yet one thing that perplexes me&mdash;has perplexed
me from the first. What is your part in this?
Raouf did not paint you exactly as a type of self-denial,
willing to stand aloof when others were reaping rich
gains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plans, like my reasons, are my own,&#8221; returned de
Proballe, with a frown. &#8220;You shall know them all in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please. It is enough for me to know that you
have them. And I have enough on my side to keep my
wits busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you but let the Governor&#8217;s men work their way
with that St. Jean all would have been well; but I scent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
danger there. Some other means of silencing him must
be found. For your part you have but to push your suit
with Gabrielle with all speed, and hasten on the marriage.
In that, the success you have gained to-day will help
you. Your act yesterday in the market place almost
turned her head; at any rate, it went to her heart. But
now, tell me of yourself, something of the story of your
life. She will surely question you, and you must have a
gallant tale to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My past, like your reasons, is my own. Should she
question me I shall know how to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whence came you here, and how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I am here may suffice. I have come to do my
task; and believe me I shall not fail to satisfy even the
Duke himself of my thoroughness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be close-lipped, it seems,&#8221; said de Proballe,
irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;No bad quality surely, when such work as mine has
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will not talk then, let us go into the house.
You will of course bide at Malincourt. Have you a
servant and apparel suited to your new position? You are
but indifferently clad now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am but a courier of fortune; but I have a servant,
and can provide for all the needs of even my high position
at Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a strange fellow, Gerard, and altogether unlike
what your letters had led me to expect. But take
your own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done that always, and shall not change even
in Malincourt. I have a matter that calls me to the
town, and will return to the maison within an hour or
so, by your leave,&#8221; and without another word he turned
and walked away, leaving de Proballe staring after him
in high dudgeon at his unexpected independence.</p>

<p>Gerard plunged along at a quick pace, his brows pent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and frowning as he thought over the extraordinary situation
in which he found himself involved. He made his
decision with characteristic promptitude. He would return
to Malincourt to see the thing through, to watch
over Gabrielle, and to play out the part for which he had
been thus unexpectedly cast.</p>

<p>There was no thought now of undeceiving her as to
his real character. That was now out of the question,
impossible, for a time at least, for her own sake no less
than for his own.</p>

<p>The explanation need not be long delayed. Once let
him get the proofs of the Governor&#8217;s connivance at the
scheme&mdash;and these he hoped to get in the interview which
de Proballe said was to take place at once&mdash;and he would
strike the power from the Governor&#8217;s hands by virtue of
the authority which his father, the Duke of Bourbon, as
Suzerain of the province, had conferred upon him.</p>

<p>But the proofs must be very clear. The times were
such that too close a scrutiny was not likely to be made
into the private lives of those holding authority. The
man who ruled his province in such a way as to relieve
those above him of trouble, and who was always to be
relied on to find troops should they be needed, could
make sure of wide tolerance in any matters of his private
life.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Duke de Rochelle was connected with
the blood royal; he could count therefore upon high
patronage and help; and there were in this connection
many reasons why Gerard must walk warily. There had
been trouble between the House of Bourbon and the
throne; and the King and his advisers would welcome
only too gladly any pretext to step in and wrest this last
lingering remnant of Bourbon suzerainty from the once
all-powerful family.</p>

<p>Gerard felt all the responsibility that rested on him;
and it was in this respect that de Proballe&#8217;s last words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
were of such importance. The Governor was betraying
himself by mixing up a personal intrigue with the work
of Government. Not content with having misgoverned
the people and overtaxed them to the verge of revolt&mdash;offences
which might have been overlooked in view of the
powerful force of soldiery he had raised and trained&mdash;he
was now contemplating a complete reversal of policy in
order to please Gabrielle for his own evil personal ends.</p>

<p>Here was Gerard&#8217;s chance, and he was quick to see
it and to determine to use it. He would continue the acted
lie of his false character until he had secured from the
Governor himself an admission of his real purpose, or had
found other incontestable proof of it&mdash;de Proballe&#8217;s word
being less than valueless; and the moment he was satisfied
he would strike.</p>

<p>To this end he sought out the young officer, Pascal,
a close intimate friend, told him much of what he had
learned, and prevailed on him to doff the monk&#8217;s cowl
and assume the character of his servant at Malincourt
during the few hours or days he might have to remain
there.</p>

<p>Pascal, to whom devilment in any form was welcome
enough, entered readily into the spirit of the adventure,
and agreed instantly. Together they obtained such apparel
as was necessary, and returned to Malincourt together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope the old rat, de Proballe, won&#8217;t recognize me,&#8221;
said Pascal. &#8220;I once won some three hundred crowns
from him, and they say he never forgets a man who has
beaten him with the dice box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am full of anxiety over this, Pascal; for Heaven&#8217;s
sake avoid every chance of a mishap,&#8221; replied Gerard
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep out of his way. Have no fear for me. Lest
he should know my voice, I&#8217;ll play the dumb man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, not that. No buffoonery, on any account.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Well, then, you can say I have taken a vow of
silence on account of the past trippings of my tongue.
The reason would be true enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is need for nothing of the kind. Keep in
the background with your eyes and ears open and your
lips closed; shun the women as you would the plague, and
all will be well. Especially, shun the women.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handsome young fellow laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shun them, if they be not too pretty; but there
are limits, Gerard. I haven&#8217;t touched a pair of lips since
I&#8217;ve been in the city; although I must say a monk&#8217;s cowl
gives rare opportunities. Were I not a soldier, on my
faith I think I&#8217;d be a monk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was received at the maison with such ceremony
as became a person of his consequence. Gabrielle and
her uncle greeted him: Gabrielle with such smiles and
gladness that Pascal ceased to wonder at his enthusiasm
for his new r&ocirc;le; and de Proballe with many significant
shrugs and looks and equivocal phrases. The rest hailed
him as the chosen husband of their beloved mistress; and
the story of his bravery and prowess in the rescue of
Denys having spread, they welcomed him with acclamation.</p>

<p>Pascal, as their new lord&#8217;s servant, would also have
been made much of; and seeing many ruddy lips and
bright eyes among the women, he would gladly enough
have responded had not Gerard&#8217;s injunctions of caution
been still strong upon him. He feigned fatigue, therefore,
and asked to be shown at once to Gerard&#8217;s apartments;
and going there, he at once fell into much deeper
waters than any which could have threatened him in any
other part of the house.</p>

<p>The apartments were close to the room where Denys
lay with Lucette in attendance. Denys was better; but
when he had been told that his preserver was no other
than Gerard de Cobalt, he had taken the news very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
strangely and had broken out into a torrent of abuse of
him. Then he had gone on to tell Lucette things which,
added to what she had heard from Jacques Dauban on
the previous evening, had frightened her profoundly.</p>

<p>But this sudden violent passion so weakened Denys
that a relapse followed; and thus Lucette had been left
with a half-told tale which he had conjured her to carry
to Gabrielle at once. She was at her wits&#8217; end what to
do, and when she heard that Gerard had arrived and was
to be lodged in rooms adjoining, she found occasion to
loiter about until she encountered Pascal.</p>

<p>Her pretty face and distracted looks went straight to
his sympathies, and when of her own motion she spoke
to him, he soon forgot all about Gerard&#8217;s counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are here with M. de Cobalt, monsieur?&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, mademoiselle, as certainly as that you are
here with some trouble of another kind than a captious
master. Although trouble may be a master of any of
us for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette was watching him, and found him good to
look upon. Handsome, frank-faced and clear-eyed, with
the stamp of truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too, are a soldier, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I am not anything else, mademoiselle. But in
times like these a man plays many parts.&#8221; She has
handsome eyes, and knows how to use them, was his
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been long with M. de Cobalt, no doubt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, mademoiselle,&#8221; was his unexpected
reply, given with an engaging smile.</p>

<p>He has a dangerous smile, this servant, and speaks
with an air, said Lucette to herself.</p>

<p>She is going to try and pump me, was Pascal&#8217;s unspoken
warning to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, monsieur! How can that be?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;It depends upon what we reckon long; whether by
lapse of time&mdash;weeks, months, years&mdash;or by the events
which have occurred. A man may know a maiden for
years until he marry her, and then find that he has never
known her at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you are a wit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am I myself know not; but I know what I
am not&mdash;and I am not a stream in which people, even
pretty maids, can fish with a chance of catching much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another thing you are not, monsieur,&#8221; retorted
Lucette, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many. I am not my master&#8217;s diary, for
others to read,&#8221; he answered with a laugh and a shake
of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither are you a servant, monsieur, unless you wear
your master&#8217;s jewels on your fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By my shroud, but you have keen eyes as well as
pretty ones; but even sharp eyes may lead one astray.
I wear this jewel by my master&#8217;s whim,&#8221; he replied unabashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see it closer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not&mdash;&#8217;tis but a paste,&#8221; and he held it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take great care of your hands, monsieur, for a
serving soldier man,&#8221; was her comment, so unexpected
that Pascal started and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I do hard work?&#8221; he asked, shrugging
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your clothes, too, are new and ill-fitting&mdash;they fit
you so ill, indeed, that I would swear you have never
worn the like before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count not the misfit to me for my sin,&#8221; replied Pascal
gaily. &#8220;&#8217;Tis that of the rascal who made them. You
interest me, mademoiselle; may I ask who you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your voice, your manner, your tone, the very bow and
air with which you asked that question, everything about
you belies the servant, monsieur,&#8221; continued Lucette. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
am Mademoiselle de Malincourt&#8217;s foster sister and friend,
Lucette de Boisdegarde; and I am on my way to tell her
of this discovery of mine and other things. You bar my
path, monsieur,&#8221; she said with dignity, as Pascal in some
dismay put himself before her. &#8220;If you are in truth a
servant, I order you to stand aside; if you are a gentleman,
I ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I detain you a moment, it is only to assure you that
Mdlle. de Malincourt and yourself can have no more
faithful friend and well-wisher than myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal de&mdash;Pascal Tourelle, at your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was quick to see the slip, and pressed home a
thrust at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;On your honour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal, on my honour; Tourelle, during my service
with my master.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, partly at the evasion, but more at his manner
of making it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were not in this service of which you speak
so readily, how would you have finished that sentence?
Pascal de&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my unhappy secret, mademoiselle; I beg your
consideration,&#8221; and his tone suggested a melancholy
trouble.</p>

<p>But Lucette smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you been a servant truly, your honour would
not have stayed you from deceiving me. If I do not go
now to mademoiselle, will you tell me all you know of
this M. de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you this, on my honour, and your honour
will prevent your asking more,&#8221; he answered after a
moment&#8217;s consideration. &#8220;A braver soldier, a more
honourable knight, a more gallant gentleman, never trod
this earth than he in whose service you now find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly, and believed him. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
this very belief only sufficed to perplex her the more after
Denys&#8217; story.</p>

<p>&#8220;One question more I must put. Do you know if he
was ever at Cambrai? Do not answer against your will,
nor if you cannot speak truly on your honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can answer that, frankly. I have known him many
years, and can say that until within the last few days,
never. We passed through the place in coming here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then is the puzzle inscrutable!&#8221; exclaimed Lucette.
Denys had told her of the murder at Cambrai, the pardon
for which was part of the price to be paid to de Cobalt,
and had spoken of a letter which he had found that put
the thing plainly. He had been in the act of telling her
where the paper was concealed, that she might get it and
carry it to Gabrielle, when the relapse had prevented
further speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not what to do,&#8221; she cried, in sore perplexity
and distress. &#8220;If I trust you, others are sadly misled.
And yet I believe you have not deceived me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour I have spoken no more than the
truth,&#8221; said Pascal earnestly. He was as much puzzled
as Lucette herself. &#8220;If you would deal with me frankly,
and say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot; I cannot,&#8221; she broke in excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then may I suggest you speak to M. de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know not what you say. But the matter must
be probed to the bottom;&#8221; and afraid to say more she left
him and hurried back to Denys&#8217; bedside.</p>

<p>Pascal looked after her, nodded once or twice in answer
to his thoughts, and then, with a quizzical smile, muttered,
as he turned back to his room&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is the devil about to claim some of his dues
for this mad business. I must find Gerard and tell
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had scarcely parted when the face of the spy
Jacques Dauban peeped cautiously round an angle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
wall. Seeing the way was clear he came on with
stealthy noiseless tread, chuckling slyly to himself as he
rubbed his hands together. He paused just a moment to
listen at the door through which Pascal had gone, and
then passed on toward the room where Denys lay.</p>

<small>THE PLOT THICKENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Gerard himself, without any help
from Pascal&#8217;s misadventure, was finding enough
embarrassments to tax his wit and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>De Proballe, anxious that Gerard should have the
fullest opportunities to push his suit with Gabrielle, soon
made an excuse to leave them together. He pleaded that
he must send to the Governor to arrange for the interview
between him and Gerard, and left them&mdash;a move
that was not without its embarrassment to Gerard, since
Gabrielle promptly took advantage of it to carry the conversation
back to the point where it had been interrupted
in the gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have something important to tell me, Gerard, I
know. You were about to tell me when my uncle came
to us. But first, I have to make a confession and to ask
your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no priest, I fear,&#8221; he said, meeting her smiling
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is a wrong done to you. When I was thinking
over all we said to-day&mdash;and I have thought of nothing
else since&mdash;I remembered to my shame, that I had
never given you even a word of thanks for your help yesterday,
and again to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please say nothing of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must have thought me a very miser of
my gratitude. And I am not that. Indeed, indeed, I do
thank you from the bottom of my heart,&#8221; she cried,
warmly, her eyes on his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;Do you think I need more reward than the
knowledge that it was you whom I could help? When I
saw you yesterday, my heart leapt, and I vowed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked, as he paused; and when he still
hesitated, checked by the thought that he had no right
to speak thus while the truth of his position was still
unexplained, she added, with a little frown and a very
winsome smile, &#8220;you break off at most irritating points,
cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I vowed myself to your service for good or ill,&#8221; he
said deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care what you say, cousin. Did you know who
I was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not then, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then was that surely a most dangerous vow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. &#8220;Supposing it had not been
Gabrielle to whom you thus rashly vowed yourself; what
would you have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought of it. No other woman would have
drawn such a vow from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You turn words well&mdash;so well that I could almost be
afraid of your skill. Shall we go out on the terrace? The
evening air is lovely. Tell me,&#8221; she said, as they walked,
&#8220;how came you to be playing trespasser so opportunely
to-day in Malincourt. It has puzzled me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell the truth, I was lurking in the wood, hoping
to catch a sight of you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had learnt who this lady of your vow was by
that time, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Else I had not been in Malincourt,&#8221; he answered,
without thinking.</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly, her face wrinkled with
this fresh puzzle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not that a worse puzzle?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Knowing
who I was, why not have come straight to the maison?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Of course, I might have done so,&#8221; he replied. He
saw the slip then clearly enough, and tried to cover it with
a laugh. &#8220;Perhaps I ought to have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did not. Why? I do not mind that you did
not, but why should you choose so strange a course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What answer can I give, save it was a whim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have seen me sooner had you come and
would not have been one whit less welcome; and would
in truth have saved me some hours of anxiety. Do you
know that, yesterday, I sent high and low in search of
you; and only this morning my poor Denys went riding
out to Beaucamp on a veritable wild-goose chase to find
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard smiled. &#8220;Did you at the time know who I
was?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I have sent away from Morvaix to find you,
had I known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you, too, were not without interest in a
stranger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a fair hit,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I would not have
had even a stranger think me an ingrate for such
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was merely to thank me, you wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard!&#8221; and she let her eyes drop to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to think that before you heard my name
to-day, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He commenced in great earnestness,
but checked himself again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day I will tell you,&#8221; she replied in a low tone,
after a pause; and then, in a tone as low, he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if I had been other than Gerard de
Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, it was not so,&#8221; she cried, with a little
shiver and a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Gabrielle?&#8221; He had his own strong reason
for pressing the question.</p>

<p>For a time she kept her head bowed and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
silent; but then raising her eyes to him frankly and trustfully
she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I should like to tell you. You will not think
shame of me. I fear I could never have been Gerard de
Cobalt&#8217;s wife. All night I wrestled with the problem,
and prayed fervently for strength to do my duty, and
keep the pledge made for me by my parents. But when
I knew Gerard de Cobalt would come to-day, I dreaded
to meet him. Can you not guess why?&#8221; She was all
blushes and sweetness as the faltered confession dropped
from her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot think what this means to me,&#8221; he answered
with passion. &#8220;But some day you will understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not now, Gerard? I have betrayed all my little
secret&mdash;little, do I say&mdash;if you but knew how great, how
all in all it is to me! I have shown you all my heart,&#8221;
she whispered.</p>

<p>They were leaning on the marble balustrade, gazing
over the lovely gardens which the risen moon was silvering
with her glory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not now, Gerard?&#8221; she repeated, after a long
pause, with sweet, gentle insistence. &#8220;What need of
secrets between us two?&#8221;</p>

<p>He longed to respond to this frank confession of her
feelings by telling her everything; and the impulse to
speak was only curbed with great effort. But prudence
stayed him, and the fear of unknown consequences which
might imperil everything by forcing a disclosure to de
Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have no secrets one from the other, Gabrielle,
when once this matter in my thoughts has been
cleared up,&#8221; he said, his reluctance to refuse her plea causing
him to speak with hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the same of which you spoke to-day so
strangely?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;The same, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were going to tell me&mdash;then.&#8221; Her pause
before the word, and emphasis in speaking it, did not
escape him. But even the subtle temptation implied in
the sweet accent did not prevail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was going to tell you. If I do not, you trust
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard, of course. I should trust you always. But&mdash;I
am only a woman, and&mdash;curious,&#8221; she added, with a
tender smile of reproachful invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I assure you it is for your own sake that I hold
this back, you will bear with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For my sake? Now in truth you increase my perplexity,
and do but whet my appetite. How can it be
for my sake? You said to-day that it concerned the very
purpose of your coming here; and when I spoke of that
purpose as I knew it&mdash;our marriage, Gerard&mdash;you started
back as if in alarm or overwhelming surprise. You
pained me so that I was leaving you in anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pain was greater on my side than yours, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then you suggested you had been led to deceive
me in some strange way: I should not believe that,
indeed; and, as if impelled by some sudden thought, you
were about to tell me everything. And then my uncle
came, and you whispered hurriedly that what you had
to say was for my ears alone. Are we not alone now?&#8221;
she asked with witching pressure; and she smiled tenderly,
as she added: &#8220;You see I remember every word
you said. Indeed, I could never forget them; but I cannot
understand&#8221;; and she shook her head as if the puzzle
were all beyond her solving.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you but trust me, what else can matter?&#8221; he answered,
at a loss how to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing now,&#8221; she cried joyfully, moving
a little closer to him so that her shoulder was against his.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
&#8220;Chide me if I seem too persistent. I have had so much
of my own way in my life that I must be getting self-willed,
I think. But don&#8217;t make the chiding too harsh,
Gerard. And do not keep me too long with this secret
between us; I think I shall grow jealous of it. And&mdash;another
condition,&#8221; she laughed: &#8220;Do not tell any one
before you tell me. I could not bear that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are even harder to resist when you yield, Gabrielle,
than when you plead, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I? Then I will yield that I may plead. But I
will wait your time. Of course I will. It is such delight
to me to find you what you are, that all else is nothing.
Besides, it is the first request you have made to me, and
I should be a churl to refuse it. I did not think of that,
and could be angry with myself for having forgotten
it. I would not hear you now, if you were to offer to tell
me.&#8221; Her laugh at this was as that of a child in its pure
delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost constrained to tempt you,&#8221; he said,
laughing in his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I have put my curiosity away&mdash;about that, but
I have plenty left about you and your life and all you
have done to change you from that boy Gerard whom I
knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very different from him, I trust. I have been
a soldier since the time I was big enough to shoulder a
musket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have fought? Tell me, tell me. Where and
with whom? I love to hear of brave deeds. I am a soldier&#8217;s
daughter, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a courier of fortune, as all younger sons
must be, and have carried arms under the Bourbons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We Malincourts, too, claim to be of the Bourbon
blood; but&mdash;how do you mean&mdash;a younger son? I had
not heard you had ever a brother, Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All soldiers have brothers-in-arms,&#8221; he replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
hastily, and with some confusion. &#8220;I have had my own
way to push&mdash;to prove that I was worthy to lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. And you have proved that long since, I
am confident. But tell me of the fighting. Oh, I would
that I had been a man to bear my part as a soldier!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That had been hard on me, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough, too. And for that I am glad I am
only a woman,&#8221; she said, gently, nestling yet closer to him.
And having thus led her on to the safe topic of his
career as a soldier, he told her many of his experiences.
She listened eagerly to his story, hanging on his words in
rare delight, until he broke off, remembering that he was
to see the Governor that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am forgetting&mdash;I could forget all in your company.
But M. de Proballe has arranged that I see the Duke to-night.
I had best seek him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be careful with the Governor, Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? I do not fear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is all-powerful here in Morvaix. You saw what
passed in the market place yesterday. He is a man of
iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet what harm can he do me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is bad to the heart&#8217;s core. His wife is my one
intimate friend in Morvaix, an honourable, God-fearing
woman, who has suffered unspeakable sorrows at his
hands in her life. She is now bed-ridden, poor soul; and
we have spoken freely together of the Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a tyrant&mdash;that I have learnt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And many worse things, I fear. I would not willingly
speak ill of any man, but to you I should speak
freely. He has but too well merited the term men give
him&mdash;the Tiger of Morvaix. Could the grim walls and
torture chambers of his castle bear witness against him,
fearsome truths indeed would come to light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, not to-night. To-night we will not speak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Morvaix horrors; rather let us hope that from to-night,
from your coming, Gerard, better times will dawn for
the city and the unfortunate citizens. The Duke is a
hard, harsh, cruel man, who tolerates but one principle
of rule: blind implicit obedience to his will, to be enforced
by any measure of cruelty, however violent and
harsh. He has ground down the people until the yoke
has become intolerable; and yet there seems no remedy.
I sent tidings privately to the Duke of Bourbon, as
Suzerain of the province, praying him to come or send
aid to us before the people should be driven to open rebellion.
But no one comes, no one heeds; and we must
work out our own rescue. I have a faint hope indeed,
that matters will mend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the Duke to-day, and urged him to relax the
severity of his rule&mdash;to take off this last cruel impost on
the people&#8217;s food, for one thing; and he half promised,
making his consent contingent on some sacrifice from
me. God knows there is nothing I would not give in such
a cause. I would strip myself of all my possessions&mdash;even
of Malincourt itself, dearly as I love every stone of the
old maison. But I hold the welfare of the people dearer.
He would not name the condition, however, leaving it to
me to do so. And I know not what he wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard&#8217;s face grew dark with anger as he listened,
knowing full well from de Proballe&#8217;s words what the
condition was.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall together find the means, Gabrielle,&#8221; he said
earnestly. &#8220;My hand and oath on that; and my life the
forfeit if I fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will help me in this,&#8221; she cried, joyfully and
eagerly. &#8220;Oh, Gerard, did I not say to-day how glad I
was that you had come! What great issues now depend
on you. With you to help me, a strong man at Malincourt,
to oppose the castle; not violently I mean, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the strength of all the people&#8217;s sympathy behind us, what
may we not achieve? But when you see the Duke, be
wary of him; give him no cause present offence that we
may be the stronger in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does any one but you know that you sent to Bourbon
for help? Your uncle, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I told no one; not even him. I deemed him too
intimate with the Governor. He would not wittingly
betray me, I know, for he has often spoken to me in sorrow
of the Duke&#8217;s government. You like him, Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen but little of him; but I have indeed found
him blunt in speaking of facts,&#8221; was the cautious reply,
drily spoken.</p>

<p>A footstep on the terrace disturbed them. It was
Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was seeking you, monsieur, to know if you have
any other commands for me,&#8221; he said aloud in a respectful
tone, adding in a whisper, as they stood apart:
&#8220;I must speak to you at once. There&#8217;s a devil of a
mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait but a minute,&#8221; whispered Gerard; and then
aloud: &#8220;I will you see directly, good Pascal. It is my
faithful fellow in some trouble about me, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us go in. Ah, here is Lucette,&#8221; she added,
as Lucette, looking very troubled, came out of the maison.
&#8220;How is Denys, Lucette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was better for some time, but the fever seems
to have come back upon him. The surgeon has seen
him again, and given him a potion, and he is now
asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He should be carefully watched all night, never left
for a moment,&#8221; declared Gerard quickly, remembering de
Proballe&#8217;s threatening words. &#8220;You will see to this,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The surgeon says he will sleep until the morning,
and will need no more till then,&#8221; answered Lucette.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Let him be watched. At need I, or Pascal here, will
remain by his bedside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, monsieur, that were not well;&#8221; and
Lucette spoke so sharply that all looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What mean you, Lucette?&#8221; asked Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys has, for causes that may be plain afterward,
conceived a violent dislike toward Monsieur de Cobalt;
and if he woke and found him by the bedside, it might
be very ill indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have never set eyes on him until to-day,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is probably no more than a sick man&#8217;s fancy,&#8221; said
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be so; yet it is very strong upon him, and he
talks wildly and almost at random.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear his wound is more serious than you deemed,
Gerard,&#8221; declared Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the more reason for what I have urged&mdash;that
he be watched closely and never left. His life itself may
hang upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see that it is done,&#8221; agreed Gabrielle readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That what is done?&#8221; It was de Proballe who asked
the question, coming out of the house in time to catch
the last words.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor Denys is very ill, it seems, uncle, and Gerard
has just been saying that he should be watched ceaselessly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; he replied in a compassionate tone; and
then with an upcast glance at Gerard he asked: &#8220;And
why do you think he should be watched so closely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had some skill in sword-wounds, monsieur,
and Mademoiselle Lucette here says he has been talking
wildly. When delirium follows such a wound as his there
is every need for care.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an adroit answer, for it satisfied de Proballe
and also bore out what he had said before. But Lucette&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
eyes were very keen, and knowing all she did, she was
watching closely enough to catch de Proballe&#8217;s glance of
meaning as he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right then, Gerard. I will see to this, Gabrielle.
Denys is too good a fellow for us to run any risks
with. My man, Jacques Dauban, has had some training
in surgery, and would gladly keep such a vigil.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette bit her lip and cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we need not trouble Master Dauban or cause
him to lose a night&#8217;s rest,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My maid and I
can watch, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever kind and considerate, Lucette,&#8221; said de Proballe.
&#8220;Well, we can see to it, as Gabrielle says. And
now, Gerard, I have a word for your ear about the
Governor. He cannot receive you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry; but to-morrow will do for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this about Denys?&#8221; asked de Proballe,
eagerly, when Gabrielle and Lucette had left them. &#8220;You
should not have urged that watching. If the man is alive
to-morrow, everything may be ruined. What has he said
to Lucette there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I neither know nor care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night, perhaps yes; sanity may come in the morning.
I have been talking long and earnestly with Gabrielle,
and her purity and innocence may have maddened me.
If that be so, it is sweet madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Psh. Spare me such cant. Would you ruin everything?
We are men with work to do, not fools to stuff
our minds with folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor villains to murder sick men. If harm should
come to Denys I should never forgive myself&mdash;nor you,
monsieur; and I should hold you responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do not wish this marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if the path to it be cold-blooded murder, Monsieur
de Proballe.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;Does it lie in your mouth to speak of murder, after
Cambrai? But your head is turned because you find your
cousin has a pretty face; and if it is not to be turned next
on the headsman&#8217;s block, you will cease this folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was held to be murder at Cambrai?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try my patience beyond endurance. See to it
that you have more reason in the morning; and that
you may find it, I will give you something to ponder in the
night. I have talked with the Duke to-night, and found
him with another plan half-fledged in his thoughts; and
if ever it gets full-feathered you may look to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems a man quick at hatching schemes. I fear
neither him nor them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool! Do you dream to oppose him? He is now half-minded
to divorce his Duchess and make Gabrielle his
wife. He finds that he stands higher in the favour of the
Cardinal Archbishop than he deemed; his Eminence has
sent him a hundred fighting men for his army; and he
now thinks he can secure a dispensation to put away his
wife. He is childless, and she a bed-ridden invalid; and
the Church might not willingly see so noble a line as his
extinct. If you do not hurry to make Gabrielle your wife,
I would not answer for your head. Ponder that to-night,
and mouth of sweet madness in the morning, if you have
any mind left for such folly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waiting for no reply, de Proballe turned on his heel
and entered the house; and as Gerard was gazing after
him, Pascal approached and touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of all the diabolical villains&mdash;What is it, man?&#8221; he
broke off impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of wasting breath in that way when
there are things to be done? This precious maison is like
a nest of spies. I&#8217;ve been found out for an impostor by
that pretty sharp-eyed girl whose lover lies wounded upstairs;
and I was wondering how to get to you to tell
you when I came on some sneaking whelp of a man with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
his ear jammed to the door of the chamber where she
was watching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you break his head for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly; but I did better. I played spy in my turn;
and your honest man can beat a rogue at his own trade
when he tries, even when that trade is spying. Presently
the rascal went to the door of the apartments where we
are to lie, and, after listening and waiting, he knocked,
at first gently, and then more boldly, and finding no one
within, entered, and I caught him ransacking among our
baggage. Holy Peter! but he cut a sorry figure when
he saw me peeping round the door at him;&#8221; and Pascal
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do? I hope you were discreet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I first knocked him down and drubbed him soundly,
and then tied him up with a roll of cloth for his supper,
and locked him in a cupboard. Then I came for you that
we may try him together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave him no time to say. But come, or he may be
smothered&mdash;for I&#8217;m a novice with the gag&mdash;and in that
case we shall get nothing out of him; which would be a
pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious turn,&#8221; said Gerard uneasily, as they
hurried away together.</p>

<small>WHAT DENYS KNEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PASCAL was all laughter and sallies as he led the
way up to their apartments, but Gerard was in
no such mood. He was very serious and full of
misgivings at the course things were taking. There were
more than enough complications in the position already
without the additional embarrassment of the bestowal of
a prisoner.</p>

<p>It was not without some sense of relief, therefore, that
he saw Pascal start as he entered the room, and heard
him exclaim in a tone of dismay&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sly devil has wriggled out, Gerard. By my
shroud, I had not deemed it possible. I put him in there
and shot the bolt upon him&#8221;; and he pointed to an
empty closet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Perhaps it is best so,&#8221; answered Gerard
with a smile. &#8220;An honest man can&#8217;t always beat a rogue
at his own trade, it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, laugh away; but he&#8217;ll not laugh if ever I set
eyes on him again, the sneaking mongrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For not waiting for your return, you mean? He
knows his business, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, that&#8217;s certain; but the point is how much he
knows of yours?&#8221; retorted Pascal. &#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive him for
knowing his own, but he shall pay the price for meddling
in mine. Were I not a fool I had mounted guard over
him and waited for you to come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he was spying upon us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I sure that we are on a queer quest here? Who
can have turned him on to such a scent?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;I should suspect de Proballe, were it not that he
knows all my supposed unsavoury history as the real de
Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has no suspicion that you are not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I can think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must be the girl who questioned me and said
I was no servant&mdash;Mdlle. de Boisdegarde,&#8221; suggested
Pascal, with a shrewd nod of the head. &#8220;I mind me
now. Are you supposed to have done some ugly thing
at Cambrai? She questioned me on the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a something which de Proballe spells murder,
and for which I am to be pardoned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand devils! I gave her my word of honour
you had never been there, except as we passed through
the place on our way here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can she have got wind of it?&#8221; and Gerard
pursed his lips thoughtfully. &#8220;Wait, wait. I see. De
Proballe told me this good fellow Denys had his suspicions.
He has told her. Phew!&#8221; he whistled. &#8220;The
plot thickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thick enough already to be a very devil&#8217;s pie of
complication,&#8221; laughed Pascal. &#8220;I suppose, as usual
you will listen to no counsel of prudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prudence, from Pascal de la Tour?&#8221; and Gerard
laughed in his turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, for myself I care nothing. Let come what may
it&#8217;s all welcome, so long as there be but some fun in it.
But your life is valuable. Would it not be wise to give
up this de Cobalt business, leave Morvaix, and return as
yourself with the troops from Cambrai?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard thought a moment, and then with another smile
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen for yourself how a certain matter
stands. Were you in my place, would you act on your
own counsel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I, on my soul. If there are two ways to an end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
I would choose that which has the more spice in it, and
devil take the danger. But you and I stand on different
footings, Gerard, and I would not so counsel you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Counsel or no counsel, I stay, Pascal. We will have
the troops up when the need calls for them. But I will
follow the spirit of your advice. I&#8217;ll write to my cousin
d&#8217;Alembert, at Cambrai, bidding him be prepared to
march hither at an hour&#8217;s notice; and to-morrow early
you must find means to despatch a messenger to him.
Then seek out Dubois, and tell him to keep in close touch
with the hundred we brought into the city as monks, so
as to assemble them at any moment. Do you know how
the hundred we played at presenting to this Governor
have been bestowed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a shrewd step,&#8221; answered Pascal, with a
laugh. &#8220;They are enrolled among the castle guards, in
accordance with the suggestion Dubois handed on from
his Eminence&mdash;yourself, Gerard. Pray Heaven, they do
but keep discreet tongues. They are tough fighters, and
every man would gladly give his life for you; but like
soldiers, they love their liquor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, or at any rate the day following, should
see all in readiness for us to act. Now let me write my
letter&mdash;a task I loathe.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Gerard wrote, Pascal left the room, wishful in
case of emergencies to learn his way better about the
great house, and he came back just as the seal was set to
the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard, that sharp-eyed beauty, Mdlle. Lucette,
wishes a word with you. I met her on the watch in the
corridor as I returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard went out to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I put a question to you, M. de Cobalt?&#8221; was
how she met him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, mademoiselle. Can I help you? You look
sorely troubled.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;Gabrielle trusts you so implicitly, monsieur, and &#8217;twas
she bade me ask you. Will you tell me why you were
so anxious that Denys St. Jean should be watched so
jealously?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave my reasons, mademoiselle. When fever and
delirium follow loss of blood from a sword-thrust there
must always be risk to the patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no delirium, monsieur. When Denys spoke
of you, he was perfectly calm and clear. At first, that
is, and until his excitement grew. But what he said of
you was said collectedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the fever is on him, and therefore he should not
be left,&#8221; said Gerard calmly.</p>

<p>She made a quick gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not answer me frankly, monsieur? Oh, pardon
me, but I am in such distress. You have some other
reasons. I saw the look that passed between you and M.
de Proballe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you ask me to interpret for you all M. de
Proballe&#8217;s looks, and to explain all you may have thought
in your excitement?&#8221; and he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys is so hot against you, and makes such charges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I warn you to set a watch over him if I myself
were minded to do him any harm for that? In all
honest truth, I care not what he may either think or say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he declares&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, I would rather not hear what he says
except from his own lips. I shall know how to answer
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her hands despairingly and was turning
away, when a further question occurred to her. &#8220;On
your honour, monsieur, you have no other reason for this
watching than what you have said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a question which I would rather that you did
not put to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we trust you so,&#8221; she cried reproachfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>He smiled again. &#8220;Then do as I have suggested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a mystery is all this;&#8221; she exclaimed, and
left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One word more, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, following
her a couple of paces. &#8220;We are soldiers and accustomed
to long watches and little sleep. One of us will be on the
watch out here in the corridor for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply; and Gerard, going back to Pascal,
told him what he proposed: that they two should watch
in turns through the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that rat will come stealing back,&#8221; said Pascal.
&#8220;If I don&#8217;t pinch his throat for him, may my fingers forget
the feel of a man&#8217;s wizen;&#8221; and he agreed readily
to take the first spell.</p>

<p>The rat did come back, more than once; but so cunningly
and softly now, so warily and so keen of scent for
the watchers, that neither Gerard nor Pascal knew of his
coming; and in the morning both agreed that they had
kept their vigil to no purpose. Could they have heard
the report which Dauban gave to his master, however,
they would have known otherwise.</p>

<p>De Proballe was ill at ease, indeed. He did not like
the attitude which Gerard had adopted. He had looked
for a pliant tool, afraid of his life; and he found instead,
a man who showed independence and firmness, who had
a will of his own, and who both said and did things that
made against his plans.</p>

<p>For his purpose it was not by any means enough that
Gerard should succeed in making a good impression on
Gabrielle. That was right, so far as it went; but Gerard
seemed to be captivated by her beauty; and that was altogether
wrong. If there was to be love between them,
the whole scheme might be jeopardised; and with it
would go his own more daring and ambitious plans.</p>

<p>Were Gerard to marry Gabrielle and then turn against
him, no one could foresee the consequences. The blundering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
interference in regard to Denys was unaccountable;
and the manner in which he had flinched from the necessary
step of dealing with one whose knowledge was so
dangerous, was profoundly disturbing. It was enough
to rouse the wrath of any one; and when Dauban brought
word that a watch was actually being kept which rendered
it impossible even to get to the door of the room,
his perplexity equalled his ill-temper.</p>

<p>He had his own standards of judging men; and he
could only come now to the conclusion that Gerard was
in some way playing for his own hand. This thought
kept him in a ferment of speculation the whole night.</p>

<p>Seeing Gerard in the gardens early, he went down to
him, resolved to have an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a word with you, Gerard,&#8221; he said, bluntly.
&#8220;We must understand one another, or this thing goes
no farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard had gone out early in the hope of seeing Gabrielle,
and was anything but pleased to have de Proballe&#8217;s
company instead; nor did he at all relish the peremptory
tone in which de Proballe spoke. Thus his answer was
sharp and curt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there we do not understand, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, you must understand that as I am
the author of this marriage scheme, you must work for
it as I direct, or it must come to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is so; and you had better know it. I first
thought of it; I found the proofs of her parents&#8217; wishes
to lay before Gabrielle; and what I made I can as easily
unmake again. I have but to speak a word and the
bubble will burst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was a lie, M. de Proballe?&#8221; asked Gerard
coldly and incisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lie, as you know perfectly well; one in which you
have already taken part, and which you have come here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
in person to continue to the end. It is useless for us to
play like children at pretences. In your letters to me you
have expressed your willingness to put yourself entirely
in my hands, to do precisely what I tell you. Now,
will you do it? If you will not, say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My memory for such matters is short, monsieur, and
in regard to all such communications I am as if I had
never penned them&#8221;; replied Gerard, after a moment&#8217;s
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is as I thought. You have some scheme of
your own to further. What is it?&#8221; De Proballe was
furious at the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it be my own, as you suggest, should I be likely to
disclose it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not deny it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not admit your right to question me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to marry Gabrielle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, if she will deign to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you set a watch outside that babbler&#8217;s
door all through the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that I did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. I know it, and that is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was right, then, in thinking you would choose the
night for your work. I set the watch, monsieur, because
I had no mind to be a party to your murderous scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will repent this attitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely. Most of us spend our lives in either committing
one blunder or repenting others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You tempt me to deem my act a blunder indeed in
bringing you to Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be part of the better understanding, the
reference to which opened our conversation. Need we
say any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the day is done you may understand better,&#8221;
cried de Proballe, furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we leave it, then, for the coming hours to decide?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
retorted Gerard, lightly and without more he
turned his back and walked away.</p>

<p>De Proballe returned to the house more uneasy and
more wrathful than ever. He seemed to see his schemes
crumbling to pieces before his eyes, and to be unable to
avert the ruin. He had built so much on Gerard&#8217;s coming
that he was loath now to carry his fears to the Governor,
and thus stop the marriage altogether; and yet it
was plain that if this was to be Gerard&#8217;s attitude when
he had married Gabrielle and was master of Malincourt,
the very marriage itself might but make matters worse
than they were at present.</p>

<p>He could not see what private scheme Gerard could
have in reserve; and came at length to think that the
success with Gabrielle had so turned Gerard&#8217;s head that
he believed himself master of the situation. From this
delusion it would not be difficult to rouse him, however.
A word or two from the Duke that his life was in danger
would soon cure this swashbuckler mood; and such a
word he could instigate at any moment. He could therefore
safely let matters run their course for the present.</p>

<p>In this temper he awaited the hour fixed for Gerard&#8217;s
interview with the Governor; but early in the forenoon
the latter arrived at Malincourt; and de Proballe
found him in a dangerous temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were to wait upon you at the Castle, Duke,&#8221; he
said, suavely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not welcome at Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can need no assurance from me, I trust, that
your presence here is an honour and a welcome condescension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; and the Governor shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;Where is Mdlle. de Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not seen my niece this morning. I will have
her sent for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that is not my wish. Where is your villainous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
jackal, de Cobalt? News has reached me that he made
much impression upon your niece yesterday. Is that so?
Speak plainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came as her betrothed, and he has done as we
would have him do, seeing the purpose in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my doubts about this affair after all,&#8221; was
the answer, with a heavy frown. &#8220;It will not suit me
that he win too far into her good graces. The thing
has cost me a sleepless night of thought, and I have come
now that I may see them together, myself unseen, and
hear them speak one to the other, that I may judge how
matters go. You will arrange this. I am consumed with
a cursed gnawing plague of jealousy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will of course understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will understand nothing but that you must do as
I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe spread out his hands and was about to
expostulate again, when the Duke cut him short, and
said very sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you do as I say, M. le Baron, or must I find
some other way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be as you please. The best plan I can conceive
is that we remain hidden here where we can watch
any one on the terrace, and I will send word to de Cobalt
that the hour is close at hand when he is to accompany
me to the Castle, and ask him to wait me on the terrace.
Then I can send for Gabrielle, and get her there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the instructions in my presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur le Duc!&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe, in a tone
of indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur le Baron!&#8221; He imitated de Proballe&#8217;s tone,
and then laughed coarsely. &#8220;I can trust my own ears,
and mean to have no warning conveyed to either of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe started and bit his lip. He had contemplated
doing the very thing the Duke insinuated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
was bitterly vexed his thought should have been read.
For a moment they faced each other, and then de Proballe
with a shrug of his shoulders turned to obey. But
at that instant the Duke caught sight of Gerard and Gabrielle
strolling in the gardens, and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to summon any one. I see them.
You will remain with me, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing back well out of sight, the Duke watched the
two lovers with intent gaze, his expression changing
gradually from eager scrutiny to one of jealous anger,
and the heavy frown deepened every moment, till at last
he burst out into angry speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;God of Heaven! it is even worse than the worst I
feared. See how they linger together over the flowers;
how she smiles to him, and he answers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does but play his part, Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that be play, then never saw I earnest. And she,
how her face lights as he speaks to her; her colour
deepens as she droops her head at his words. See how she
lays her hand tenderly on his arm; and he, how he
stoops over her hand and raises it to his lips, and she&mdash;by
the God that made us all, she loves him. Look at the
light in her eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is our man, my lord, and sows but for us to reap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be a bitter crop for some of us, or I am no
ruler in Morvaix. &#8217;Twas not for this we sent for him.
And you say they never met till yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Till yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke turned from the window, and paced the room
with quick angry strides, his face black as night and his
eyes blazing with hot jealous rage. De Proballe watched
him stealthily, wondering what this new dangerous mood
portended.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming to the terrace,&#8221; he said at length;
and the two watchers concealed themselves close by the
open casement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>The lovers approached, all unsuspecting that keen
vengeful eyes were bent upon them from under the
strained pent brows of a man half mad with jealous
frenzy. And a handsome picture they made as they
came up the broad steps laughing gaily in the sweet
abandonment of new-found all-trusting love.</p>

<p>Gabrielle held in one hand the kerchief with which she
had at first covered her head, and in the other was a
posy of freshly plucked flowers, from which she had
chosen a red rose to give to Gerard. Her face was
radiant with smiles and her eyes glowed as she turned
them ever and again upon her handsome lover by her side.
At the head of the steps she stayed and leant in a graceful
pose against the marble pillar on which stood the
statue of a fantastically carved faun.</p>

<p>&#8220;And must you really go now to the Castle?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Proballe named this hour, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am loath for you to go, cousin; yet could wish you
gone that I may look for your return, and long for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not think I leave you willingly?&#8221;</p>

<p>A tender glance was the answer, and at the sight of
it the angry man within the room close by drew in his
breath sharply as if in pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I shall count the minutes till you return,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Am I not foolish? But your coming has
changed my world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it be foolishness, then it is good to be foolish,&#8221;
returned Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be careful with the Duke, remembering what
I have told you, Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to think of you, Gabrielle, and the thought
will inspire me to caution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would I could be present. Not that I doubt you;
maybe,&#8221; she smiled, &#8220;it is only because I do not like to be
parted from you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;The minutes will be no less leaden to me while I
am away;&#8221; and again they smiled each to the other with
such a glance that the Duke could endure no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must end,&#8221; he whispered fiercely. &#8220;I will bear
no more;&#8221; and he was moving impetuously when de Proballe
stayed him and whispered in reply&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you have patience, my lord. He is but adopting
my suggestion and wooing her that the marriage may
take place the sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he must find some other way. It is hell to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay; some one comes. By all the saints in heaven,
it is Denys!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was walking with difficulty, and leaning on Lucette&#8217;s
arm for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is he who knows something of our plans, my
lord, and should have been silenced by your men yesterday.
He must be stopped, or he will poison her ears
against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Duke, catching eagerly at the words, laid a
strong hand on de Proballe&#8217;s arm and held him as he
whispered in tense accents&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him do it, and I will thank him. Stay, monsieur, I
order you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In dire consternation de Proballe, now much agitated,
fell back to his place, and both were again silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys, Denys, what madness is it that brings you
from your sick bed thus?&#8221; cried Gabrielle, in surprise
and some alarm for him. &#8220;You are risking your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no madness, mademoiselle, and my life would
be cheaply spent in such a case,&#8221; answered Denys, speaking
with great labour and seeming even to breathe with
difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not stay him, Gabrielle,&#8221; said Lucette, in response
to Gabrielle&#8217;s look of reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not come to me when I sent for you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
mademoiselle,&#8221; said Denys slowly, when he had found
breath. &#8220;So I came to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not come then, and did but delay, good Denys.
But what is this matter that could not wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That man is the matter&mdash;Gerard de Cobalt. I know
the truth of his coming hither and his treachery, and not
another hour was to be lost before I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys! How dare you speak thus? You presume
upon my good will. It was M. de Cobalt who saved your
life yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God I had lost it rather than that it should be
saved by him. As Heaven is my witness, I speak but the
truth when I say he is a villain; and I can and will prove
my words by his own testimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s tense silence followed this fierce accusation;
and in it the Duke whispered under his breath&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It grows interesting. I hope he will make good his
words. He is an honest sturdy fellow, and looks as
earnest as he is sincere. A good witness, and welcome.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>THE ACCUSATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO Gerard the turn of events was profoundly disturbing.
He had heard from both Lucette and
de Proballe that Denys had suspicions of the
reasons which were supposed to have brought him to
Morvaix, and knew something of the unsavoury past of
the man whose name he had taken; and to have all this
blurted out to Gabrielle might have very ugly consequences.</p>

<p>Almost any other moment would have been less inopportune,
as it seemed; and he would have given much
to be able to silence his accuser. Yet he could not appear
to shun the charge or shrink from any proofs which Denys
had obtained: could do nothing in fact. It was the irony
of the thing that the very interference which he would
have welcomed at the fitting moment should be so embarrassing
now.</p>

<p>Gabrielle had, however, only one thought. To her it
seemed treachery even to listen further to the accusation.
She was very angry, and her face mantled with colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been a faithful friend to me, Denys,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and are ill with your wound. Were it otherwise,
your present act would part us. There is no place in
Malincourt, or in my service, for any one who maligns
my friends. Lucette, it pains me that you are in this.
Gerard, will you take me into the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerard&#8217;s honour and instincts of fairness forbade
acquiescence in this unjust rebuke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;Nay, Gabrielle, I believe you are too hard upon M. St.
Jean and upon Mdlle. Lucette as well. It is but his zeal
for you that makes him indiscreet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fool, the fool!&#8221; muttered de Proballe. &#8220;When
she would have shut her own ears to the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear M. de Cobalt, Denys. Take lesson by his
generosity. Go back to your chamber, and when you are
well, in mind and body both, I will hear you. Lucette, see
to this.&#8221; She spoke with all the dignity of one who meant
to be obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no power to prevail with him, Gabrielle. He
urged me first to come with this story to you, and when
I would not, rose from his bed and insisted on seeking
you for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denys appeared to be almost spent with his effort. He
stood leaning against the parapet in such desperate
straits that Gabrielle was touched with deep compassion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am passing, I think,&#8221; he said. His face was deadly
grey as he clung to the marble with one hand while with
the other he felt for a paper and drew it out. He seemed
so near collapse that Gerard stepped forward to help
him; but anger rallied him and he waved away the proffered
help with a gesture of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God he falls before he can do more mischief,
the meddling dog!&#8221; muttered de Proballe again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead him away, Lucette,&#8221; said Gabrielle, in pain at
the sight. But Denys would not go; and after an effort
he said slowly with much effort and many a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My last strength can have no better use than in this
for you, mademoiselle. This letter&mdash;from M. de Cobalt
to M. de Proballe. Read it, for the love of God, read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys, Denys, how can you ask such unworthiness?&#8221;
cried Gabrielle indignantly, her eyes and voice full of reproach.
&#8220;If it be M. de Cobalt&#8217;s letter, give it to him.
Would you have me imitate you and play the spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak not so harshly, Gabrielle,&#8221; exclaimed Lucette.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>But Denys stopped her and spoke again, moving a
step toward Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He would marry you but to betray you to the Duke.
&#8217;Tis my last word. He says it here.&#8221; Holding the letter
in his now trembling fingers he made a great effort to
reach Gabrielle with it, his staring eyes fixed earnestly
and imploringly upon her. But his fever-racked strength
was gone. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake be warned,&#8221; he mumbled
half-incoherently. It was his last effort. As the words
dropped from his lips, he fell prone to the ground, the
letter fluttering from his nerveless fingers to Gabrielle&#8217;s
feet.</p>

<p>Lucette with a cry knelt beside him.</p>

<p>Gabrielle had shrunk from his approach, but now stood
gazing down on him, pity, pain and distress in her eyes.
And Gerard stooped and felt his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has but fainted,&#8221; he said, looking up. &#8220;Let him
be carried back to the bed he should never have left. He
is a noble faithful fellow and has freely risked his life
for what he deems the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, Gerard! Splendidly played. Did you mark
that, my lord?&#8221; whispered de Proballe, intensely relieved
at Denys&#8217; collapse. &#8220;What an actor the villain is,
Duke? Said I not he was but acting with Gabrielle? You
could swear that tone of his was a note of honourable
innocence.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Duke made no reply. He was staring with
pent gloomy brows at the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bear him no grudge for this, Gerard?&#8221; said
Gabrielle with a smile of confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I feel enmity to one whose only motive was
desire to serve you and who has drawn this further
proof of your trust in me? He did and said no more
than he deemed both right and true. I honour him for
his courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will tear the letter that appears to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
cheated his fevered wits, and so end the matter;&#8221; and
picking up the paper she was about to tear it when he
stopped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool! Idiot! Now indeed he goes too far;&#8221; muttered
de Proballe, as he saw the gesture. &#8220;Let her
tear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard had the strongest reasons for not having the
letter destroyed, however. It was the proof he needed
to make de Proballe&#8217;s guilt clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not destroy it, Gabrielle. There must be
much behind this which we do not yet understand; and
if it is to be cleared, this letter may be needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but the delusion born of fever madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men do not forge letters in delirium,&#8221; answered
Gerard quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not have me read it!&#8221; Gabrielle&#8217;s eyes
were wide with astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will the fool do next?&#8221; murmured de Proballe,
in deep agitation. &#8220;Is he aiming this at me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard paused a moment to think, and then answered
calmly and firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I would have you read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is designed to slander you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too sure of your trust to fear any slander,
Gabrielle. I would have you read it, whatever it be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Cross! he plays a bold hand,&#8221; muttered the
Duke, drawing his breath. &#8220;What is in the letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will ruin everything,&#8221; whispered de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do I not understand him. He must indeed be
sure of her, as he says;&#8221; and his frown grew deeper
than before.</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood fingering the letter in hesitation some
moments and then unfolded it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do your bidding, Gerard, although I had
rather not.&#8221; She read it then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">To M. Le Baron de Proballe</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The messenger has brought me your last communication
and the sum of money I asked for. My doubts
are almost satisfied. I have some troublesome matters
to arrange, and some little time must pass before
they can be settled. But you can count upon my
reaching Malincourt by the end of June or the first days
of July, if in response to this you send me a declaration
under the Duke de Rochelle&#8217;s own hand that I shall
receive his pardon for the affair at Cambrai. You must
procure this; as without it I shall not trust myself within
his province.</p>

<p>&#8220;You require me to state my acceptance of your
proposal specifically. I now do this. I will marry
Gabrielle. She shall never learn from me that her
parents never expressed any such wish for our marriage
as she has been told. I will use my utmost efforts to
compel her, if need be, to submit to the Duke&#8217;s wishes.
And I will act in every way faithfully as you may direct
in any other plans you have.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fortune I shall receive with Gabrielle will be
all I need&mdash;that and the pardon; for I seek no Court
position, favour, or influence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send me the written assurance of the pardon, and
by the time the messenger can return hither, I may be
ready to set out myself.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gerard de Cobalt.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;By the God above us all, what callous infamy!&#8221; exclaimed
Gerard, passionately, stirred to the depths by the
letter, whose full meaning he well understood. But it was
otherwise with Gabrielle, who saw in it no more than
an attempt to slander him; and she mistook his burning
words for indignation at the effort to ruin him in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infamy indeed,&#8221; she said warmly. &#8220;Would that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
knew the author of so vile a slander! If I thought for
a moment that Denys&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Gabrielle. Don&#8217;t even speak such a
thought,&#8221; cried Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgotten him,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;I will help
bear him into the house. We will deal with this afterwards,
Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except to find the villain who forged the letter, there
is no more to do in it, Gerard. They little know me
who think I could be moved by so contemptible a lie.
I could ask your pardon for having read it to the end&mdash;could
almost be vexed with you, indeed, for having
caused me to read it. Shall I tear it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was bending over Denys and looked up quickly.
&#8220;No, I will keep it; and some one some day shall pay
a heavy reckoning,&#8221; he answered as he took it. Then
with Lucette&#8217;s help he lifted Denys and took him into
the house. Gabrielle was following, when the Duke said
hurriedly to de Proballe&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and detain her on the terrace. I must speak with
her; but first will think a space. I am on the rack.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been profoundly moved by the scene and was
intensely agitated. He had let the letter be read without
interference&mdash;involving though it did both de Proballe
and himself&mdash;in the belief that the revelation of Gerard&#8217;s
baseness would change her feelings; and the unshaken
confidence she had shown in Gerard&#8217;s honour was to his
jealousy as biting acid to an open wound.</p>

<p>With a bitterness beyond words to describe and far
too galling for his selfish soul to endure, he saw now that
in causing Gerard to be brought to Morvaix for his own
purpose with Gabrielle, he had but plunged a sword into
his own heart. The villain had played his part so well
that he had won her love; and the wound burned and
stabbed and maddened him with its pain.</p>

<p>But he would have his revenge. No man should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
suffered to come between him and his desires. If this de
Cobalt had won her love, he should pay the price. His
rival&#8217;s life lay in the palm of his hand; and in Morvaix
at least there was none to step between him and the
object of his hate.</p>

<p>It was a treacherous betrayal; nothing else. Pretending
to keep the letter of his pledge, Gerard had broken
the spirit, and should be trusted no more. The pardon for
the murder at Cambrai should be withheld, unless&mdash;and
his eyes gleamed dangerously at a fresh thought and he
smiled with a cunning pleasure.</p>

<p>Gabrielle loved this de Cobalt; and the love would put
a weapon in his hands powerful enough to break her to
his purpose.</p>

<p>His new resolve was quick to take shape. She should
be his wife; and the price of her consent should be her
new lover&#8217;s life. The old scheme should be laid away;
and with it would go at a stroke all need for de Cobalt&#8217;s
services. His next move was soon decided; and he
stepped out and joined Gabrielle and her uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make no apology for thus breaking upon you suddenly,
because the reason for it is your own welfare,&#8221; he
began, speaking deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust your lordship does not deem an apology necessary
for visiting Malincourt,&#8221; replied Gabrielle, courteously,
but wondering at his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no ordinary visit of courtesy, mademoiselle;
and if the manner of it is unusual and displeasing, as
it may well be, the purpose will, I hope, prove its excuse.
We have been close observers of the scene which has just
occurred here&mdash;as M. de Proballe has perhaps told you.&#8221;
But de Proballe had done nothing of the kind, and he
started in some dismay at the words. His start was lost
by Gabrielle, however, in her intense surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Observers, my lord? I fear I do not understand,&#8221;
she replied with dignity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Yet my words explain my meaning. Very evil intelligence
has reached me concerning this M. de Cobalt;
and in my zeal for your welfare I came this morning to
confer with M. de Proballe; and we arranged the scene
that this man&#8217;s character might be tested openly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should prefer that M. de Cobalt be present, my
lord.&#8221; Gabrielle took fire instantly, and she made no
attempt to disguise her indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not necessary. His presence or absence is a
matter of no concern. What you have heard of him
to-day and read in that letter of his is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began hastily, then checked
herself and said proudly: &#8220;But I will not deign to ask a
question. Your lordship must be entirely in error. I have
unbounded faith in M. de Cobalt&#8217;s honour. It is a matter
your lordship must excuse my declining to discuss.&#8221; The
Duke frowned, but repressed his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand your feelings,&#8221; he said calmly.
&#8220;Would that the man were worthy of it! I honour
you for this attitude and would gladly spare you the
pain which the truth must cause you; but it must be told,
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle would not answer, and the Duke turned to
de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell your niece, monsieur, that that letter
was written to you by M. de Cobalt himself in reply to
others from you to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you and I had better discuss this further,&#8221;
said de Proballe, in a desperate shift at the new position.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my wish, monsieur,&#8221; replied the Duke coldly,
with a glance of menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even my uncle himself will not shake my confidence
in M. de Cobalt, although he may change my feelings
toward himself,&#8221; declared Gabrielle, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Proballe,&#8221; said the Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not your intentions,&#8221; he answered, in a fever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of disquiet. &#8220;I&mdash;I scarcely heard what the letter contained;
and&mdash;and before I can say so much I&mdash;ought to
see it&mdash;to examine it.&#8221; He stumbled and hesitated over
the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand, M. le Baron, that you give me the
lie?&#8221; and the cold cutting words were accompanied by a
look that no one could misunderstand.</p>

<p>&#8220;God forfend; but I wash my hands of the whole
affair,&#8221; he cried, with a gesture of profound agitation
and a sigh. &#8220;It is true, Gabrielle. The letter was written
by Gerard to me some time since. It is one of several
that have passed between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe it;&#8221; and Gabrielle drew herself up
in proud repudiation of the further attack upon the man
she loved and trusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my honour it is so, mademoiselle,&#8221; declared the
Duke. &#8220;And now I must make my confession of the
part I have played in this. It is no humour of mine to
seek others&#8217; forgiveness, but for what I have done in all
this distressful error, I do beg yours. It was at my
instance that this de Cobalt was brought to Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do I thank you, my lord, and, believe me, I
see nothing in the act which calls for forgiveness,&#8221; interposed
Gabrielle swiftly, as he paused. He took no notice
of the interruption; he was too deeply engrossed in thinking
how to put his case most plausibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My motive you will at least admit was worthy&mdash;it
was the good of the people of Morvaix. Next to myself,
the House of Malincourt is the most potent influence here,
and thus the subject of your marriage has given me much
thought. It would have been a disaster had you fallen
under the sway of some unworthy man and been prevailed
upon to marry him, and so let the influence of
your house pass into evil hands. To prevent this, we&mdash;for
your uncle has shared my views and acted with me
throughout&mdash;we planned to arrange your marriage with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
a man who would place himself under our guidance in
all matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your lordship and you, monsieur, chose a man
whose life was so evil&mdash;if this lying letter were to be
credited&mdash;that he only dared to come hither when he had
been assured under your lordship&#8217;s own hand of a pardon
for some foul offence. Surely you would not have me
credit this of you! I do not. I will not. For it involves
a cruel slander upon my true and gallant cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the Duke says is true in every word, Gabrielle,&#8221;
declared de Proballe, much relieved at the astute line the
Governor was taking.</p>

<p>&#8220;We did not know the evil history of this man,&#8221; continued
the Duke in the same quiet deliberate tone; &#8220;or
he would never have been brought here. I have but
learned it within the last few hours. The affair at Cambrai
was mistold to us; and I have but just gathered
the full details of what I find to have been a foul and
most treacherous murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>A contemptuous smile of disbelief was Gabrielle&#8217;s only
answer to this; but it was more eloquent than many words
of her unshaken and unshakable faith in Gerard. The
Duke paused, and after a moment resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had heard that he had repented of his old excesses
and wrong living, and when we sent for him,
believed this to be the case. But when we found that
his repentance was but acted lying&mdash;in which he is an
adept&mdash;there seemed no course open but to put him to
the proof by confronting him with his own writing, so
that your eyes might be opened and yourself convinced
of the impossibility of a marriage with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have yet to be convinced, my lord; and know no
power or means on earth strong enough to convince me.
My parents&#8217; wishes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were but M. de Proballe&#8217;s invention, mademoiselle,&#8221;
interposed the Duke, in the same cold deliberate tone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
&#8220;The story was designed to influence you to agree. That
is all. In that we did wrong&mdash;grievous wrong, no doubt;
for deceit with whatever motive used must always be
wrong; and in this case it has ended disastrously. For
that, as well as for the pain which, with all zeal for your
real welfare, I have caused you, I crave your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you indeed done the harm you fear, I would
never forgive you. I never could,&#8221; answered Gabrielle,
firmly; then breaking into a smile she added: &#8220;but if
indeed you have brought my cousin here, then do I thank
you, as I say. Aye, thank you with all my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do but jest in a very grave issue, mademoiselle.
This marriage is impossible.&#8221; There was less deliberateness
and more sternness in the Duke&#8217;s tone now, and it
provoked Gabrielle&#8217;s pride. Unmistakable defiance was
in her look and mien as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;By your lordship&#8217;s leave, I am head of my house;
and if that part of what you have said be true&mdash;that my
parents have expressed no wish for my marriage&mdash;I am
free to choose without let or hindrance from any man.
But here comes my cousin. He will know how to answer
for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Gerard came out of the house he started at seeing
who was present, and then came on with firm step and
confident bearing, and smiled to Gabrielle as he reached
her side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>THE DUKE&#8217;S SENTENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GERARD saw at once by the faces of all three
that some fresh complication had occurred during
his absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad you have come, Gerard,&#8221; said Gabrielle.
&#8220;M. le Duc de Rochelle and my uncle have made
some charges which you will be glad to face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he answered, with a bow to the Governor
and a quick glance at de Proballe. The Duke took no
notice of his salutation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a conversation yesterday concerning the
reason for your coming to Morvaix,&#8221; said de Proballe.
&#8220;You have not forgotten it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely to have forgotten. Do you wish it
repeated now?&#8221; Gabrielle smiled confidently at the tone
in which this was said. Gerard spoke as the challenger,
not the challenged. There could be no mistaking that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this to me,&#8221; interposed the Duke abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He admitted everything to me yesterday,&#8221; declared
de Proballe; but the Duke waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, monsieur,&#8221; he said sharply to Gerard. &#8220;A
letter of yours to M. de Proballe was read this morning.
Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter was read. It is here;&#8221; and he took it from
his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke and my uncle were listening to our conversation,&#8221;
said Gabrielle quietly. &#8220;They say that the
statements in the letter are true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be,&#8221; he said readily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Gerard!&#8221; Gabrielle&#8217;s was a cry of consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think he would dare to deny it, mademoiselle?&#8221;
asked the Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no reason for any alarm, Gabrielle. On
my honour you need but have patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honour!&#8221; exclaimed the Governor contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does such a word seem strange to the ears of the
Duke de Rochelle?&#8221; asked Gerard, quite unmoved as he
met the angry look the question drew forth. &#8220;What are
the charges your lordship brings against me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those contained in your own letter; the letter which
confesses the truth. Do you deny you wrote that letter
to M. de Proballe?&#8221;</p>

<p>For one moment Gerard hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The statements contained in that letter so far as they
touch me are absolutely false,&#8221; he declared emphatically.
&#8220;That I affirm on my honour, Gabrielle; but for the
moment I cannot explain the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no more. I was sure you would repudiate
them,&#8221; she answered exultantly. &#8220;I shall stay to hear
no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should prefer you to remain, mademoiselle,&#8221; said
the Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crave your lordship&#8217;s permission to retire. I can
hear no more of this attack upon my cousin. I am satisfied.
I have his assurance;&#8221; and without waiting for
any permission to be given, she went into the house.</p>

<p>Gerard was glad to be left to deal with the matter in
her absence. He recognized the extreme difficulty of the
situation and the utter impossibility of giving a rational
explanation without telling the truth about himself; but
he was anxious to have some plain speaking with the
Governor, and he turned at once to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship will perhaps see the desirability of explaining
this new development to me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an insolent rascal in all truth,&#8221; was the fiery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
reply. &#8220;It is from you I demand the explanation. See
to it that it is satisfactory. I am not wont to be trifled
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no trifling in all this. Will you explain it, M.
de Proballe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You play the braggart well, Gerard, on my soul; and
if I see your object may I be cursed. When with me
yesterday you admitted everything; and now to-day you
deny your own writing, and pledge your honour the very
things you have written are false.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard regarded him sternly. &#8220;Would you have had
me tell that I was brought here to Morvaix to marry
Gabrielle in order to ruin her?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is false!&#8221; cried the Governor.</p>

<p>A flush of anger mounted to Gerard&#8217;s face at this
insult.</p>

<p>&#8220;It accords ill with your reputation for courage, M.
le Duc, that you insult a man to whom your position
denies the right to call you to account. If you have
no other tone to adopt toward me, I will retire. But
with M. de Proballe the matter stands otherwise. You
will guard your tongue, monsieur, or I shall hold you
responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an impudent swashbuckler is this murderer,&#8221;
sneered the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no murderer, my lord,&#8221; asserted Gerard, hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means he holds your Grace&#8217;s pardon for the deed,&#8221;
said de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not save you,&#8221; declared the Governor, bluntly.
&#8220;You have broken your word and must take the consequences.
I will waste no time with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what have I broken my word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not stoop to bandy words with you. I have
changed my plans; that is enough for you to know. You
are no longer of use to me. But you can have one chance
to save your skin. You came under the protection of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
assurance. You can leave it again; and never dare in
the future to show your villainous face within my province.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not leave,&#8221; answered Gerard, every whit as
firmly. &#8220;I have come for a purpose, and that purpose
I shall fulfil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare to defy me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My words are my words and I will not recall them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, you are a brazen scoundrel. But do
not imagine that Mademoiselle de Malincourt can protect
you. She is not to be polluted by a marriage with such
as you. More of this, and I will withdraw what I have
said and have you flung into gaol at once to pay the
penalty for your crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be as your lordship will. I will not leave
Morvaix even at your bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment the Duke&#8217;s fury seemed uncontrollable;
but he mastered it and his tone when next he spoke
was cold, tense, and full of menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be better so, perhaps; but you shall have the
chance I named. Understand me plainly. I will give you
twenty-four hours in which to put as great a distance as
you can between you and Morvaix. At noon to-morrow
my troops will start to hunt you down; and whenever and
wherever they find you I swear that you shall die for
that Cambrai murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your hounds will not have far to seek. They will
find me here in Morvaix,&#8221; returned Gerard calmly. &#8220;I
am not unwilling to witness your methods of trial and
justice here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not lack the chance, I promise you. One
other condition for your life I make. Before you leave
the city you will return the paper sent to you from me
by M. de Proballe. For the rest, look to yourself; for
as I live, it will need all your wits and more than all
your effrontery to save you from my hands.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>With that he turned his back on Gerard, saying to de
Proballe that he would speak again to Gabrielle before
leaving Malincourt. They walked away together, and
Gerard turned and paced the terrace in busy thought.</p>

<p>One thing chiefly perplexed him&mdash;why the Duke had
shewn this change of front and now wished to drive him
from Morvaix instead of seconding the scheme for the
marriage. It did not occur to him to set it down to the
true cause&mdash;jealousy; and he racked his wits vainly to
find a solution.</p>

<p>The only reason that suggested itself to him was one
that strengthened his resolve to stay&mdash;that the Duke&#8217;s
object was to rob Gabrielle of even the slender protection
which his presence afforded. If that were so, it followed
that there was some fresh scheme on foot to do Gabrielle
immediate hurt; and in that view no consideration whatever
should induce him to leave.</p>

<p>But in such a case, why had not the Governor taken
the simpler course of handing him over to his soldiers
at once? In seeking the answer to that question Gerard
came much nearer the truth. If he were to run away,
his flight would be tantamount to a confession that these
charges against himself were true; and Gabrielle would
be led to hold him for the villain which the real de Cobalt
unquestionably was. He would be seen to have pledged
his honour to her, only to break it in a cowardly flight.</p>

<p>Had the villainous de Cobalt stood in his place, he
would no doubt have gladly welcomed the chance of
saving his life at the sacrifice of his honour and of Gabrielle;
and the Duke had acted on that supposition.</p>

<p>Nothing should induce him to fall into the snare thus
spread for him; but at the same time he felt that he
must take measures for self-preservation. This Tiger
in his passion was capable of going to any lengths; and
means must be at hand to restrain him.</p>

<p>He was still pondering this when Gabrielle came out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
from her interview with the Duke. Her bright looks
had given place to a troubled expression, and she was
very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor is like a madman in his wrath against
you, Gerard,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have never seen him so moved.
Both he and my uncle are now as furious at the thought
of our marriage as before they&mdash;or at least my uncle&mdash;was
eager to promote it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Gabrielle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not how to act or what to say,&#8221; she replied
with a sigh of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tension of this morning&#8217;s scene has tried you,&#8221;
he said gently. &#8220;But you do not believe I am the dastard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard! No. I cannot. Every prompting of my
heart bids me trust you. I think I would trust you if all
the world bore witness against you. But there must surely
be some explanation of so great a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me?&#8221; he asked with sudden fervour, taking
her hand and searching her eyes with his, in which the
fire of love burned. She left her hand in his willingly and
trustingly and met his gaze with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not shown it? Do you need any other answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a love strong enough to face even this trial?&#8221;
he insisted earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never change, Gerard. Nothing could change
my heart&mdash;not even if all this were proven against you,
as they both swear it can be. It would break my heart
and blight my life; but my love would never change.
And believe it I never would or will, unless your own
lips tell me it is true; and even then my heart would
rebel against your words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never tell you that,&#8221; he replied, vehemently.
&#8220;Thank God there is no reason why I should not take
your hand and look into your own innocent eyes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
swear on my soul that all this charge passes me by as
an idle breeze. You will never have cause to regret your
sweet trust. That on my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have they made these charges? I am so sorely
perplexed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will all appear in time, Gabrielle. There is dark
and evil work behind, and I am resolved to drag it to
the light of day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when? They tell me you are going away again!
Ah, Gerard, my heart fell at the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but one more falsehood. Only one thing can
drive me from Morvaix&mdash;your own sentence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet they urged me to counsel you to go, saying that
if you stay here you will be imprisoned. What is this
affair at Cambrai which they call by the fell name of murder?
Do not let my question anger you; but if there
be really danger, you must fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor would have me fly that you may be
driven to deem me the guilty wretch he describes me.
There is no danger to me, but rather to them; to the
Governor himself indeed most of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do? No deed of violence,
Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Violence there may have to be; but not of the kind
in your thoughts. I am no assassin, whether at Cambrai
or here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have some scheme with which to combat
him? Can you not tell me that?&#8221; she asked with
almost wistful eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one that would speak to your heart, Gabrielle,
for it will touch the welfare of all in Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you frighten me. Would you further a revolt
here? Heaven knows our wretched people are hot
against him and ripe for a movement of the kind. But
he is so strong in his soldiery, the end would be but
useless bloodshed to be followed by even more grinding
tyranny and misery for the city.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;Harbour no fears of that. Stay, what if I could
lead a movement here which, without the evil things
that make your woman&#8217;s heart shrink, could yet break
this Tiger&#8217;s power and give good and just government
to the people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not possible, Gerard. You speak at random.
You are not known in Morvaix; and the people would
not follow an unknown leader. Yet I have dreamed of
something of the kind since you came. Were you but
once established firmly as lord of Malincourt and had
had time to win the confidence of the people and their
trust, as you would win it, then&mdash;but there, it is
no more than a dream conjured up by finding you the
man you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I test your trust still further? I have my
reasons, God knows, for thus testing you. If I were in
very truth the wretch the Duke has painted me, and
yet had the means to do what I have said and came to
you in the moment of my triumph and asked you to
be my wife, how would you answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would lay my hand in yours without a question,
Gerard, sure that, whatever your past, you had redeemed
it for my sake.&#8221; She gave her answer without a falter
or a second of hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God and you for those words and that trust,
Gabrielle,&#8221; he cried, with fervent passion. &#8220;If I am
ever unworthy of it, may God deal with me for a traitor!
The time for me to claim you so will come, and until
it comes I will wait to seek from your lips the kiss
of betrothal. Now am I sure indeed that all will be
well with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not remain in Morvaix?&#8221; she asked,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I leave you after this?&#8221; he replied tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should understand the reason of your going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have far stronger reasons to remain near you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;I think you should not. I am safe; but I fear for
you; and my fear will not pass while you remain here.
I am going to-day to the Duchess and shall seek her
aid and counsel&mdash;telling her all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a surety to the Castle. She has sent an urgent
message to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I scent trouble in it. I do not like you to trust
yourself in that man&#8217;s power. If you go, I shall go
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are needlessly alarmed. She is my friend, and
as good a woman as ever drew breath. I am often with
her. I could not refuse; but it would be madness for
you to think of going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The term madness does not hinder me. For the part
I have to play a bold front is not only necessary,
it is prudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can serve no useful end by such a venture.
The Duke might offer you violence, indeed, in his
anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find a pretext and would gladly have a chance
to get within the walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be less easy to find one to get out, Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so the work I have to do would not be stayed.
I am firm on the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like the look of it;&#8221; and Gabrielle&#8217;s face
clouded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The look may change on closer view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harm will come of it, Gerard. Let me prevail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When my work is done you shall never prefer a
request in vain. But this you must not press.&#8221; She
yielded then, albeit with anxiety and misgivings; and
they went into the house.</p>

<p>Gerard hastened to his apartments to wait for Pascal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
and to complete the arrangements for striking the blow
upon which he had now decided.</p>

<p>When Pascal arrived the two had a long conference,
and once again Pascal advised a policy of caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t set your foot inside the Castle gates,&#8221; he
urged vigorously. &#8220;It can do no good and may work
incalculable mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you go in my stead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all the willingness in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall the leader shirk the risk which his followers
would take? Is it thus we Bourbon leaders
lead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no reason. There are times, of course, when
the leader should be first, but this is not one of them.
You know what sort of wild beast government this is
in Morvaix; you have now ample cause to do all you
will against the Governor; ride out then to Cambrai and
yourself bring up the troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall a Bourbon give men cause to sneer at him for
a coward? Nay, Pascal, you would but anger me to
press such counsel further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your life to me and to us all is too precious to
be risked in such a venture. I know what Dubois
would urge were he here. Still, let it be as you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not risking my life, man. Do you think this
Duke, daredevil though he be, will venture to harm
Bourbon&#8217;s son when once I declare myself? His own
soldiers would revolt against it. No man shall call me
poltroon; and none has ever before advised me to deserve
such a term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you wrong me, Gerard. But I say no
more. Pray heaven no harm come of it. It was my
duty to urge this counsel, but I knew you would not
so act;&#8221; and Pascal smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;To our plans then. Another messenger must be
found to ride to Cambrai with all the haste possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and carry this message to my cousin. In it I have
urged him to bring up the troops with all despatch. If
your courier of this morning gets first to hand, d&#8217;Alembert
will be already preparing; if not, this urgent message
will hurry him. If our messenger gets quickly to
him some eight-and-forty hours should see him without
the city here; and I have told him to ride straight in
unless a messenger from me meets him with a further
despatch. By nightfall, on the day after to-morrow at
latest, he should be here; and within that short space no
great harm can happen to either Mademoiselle de Malincourt
or to me, let this Governor do what he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be a shrewder plan to get her to ride with
you to Cambrai and return with the troops,&#8221; said Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thought has not escaped me; and it may come
to it yet. We shall see. Failing it, I have this plan: Let
Dubois or yourself choose some likely place in the city
to which our fellows can be brought, so that at need,
should trouble come, we can make a stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is more to my liking,&#8221; said Pascal, gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;And lastly for yourself, Pascal. Don&#8217;t return here,
but don once more your monk&#8217;s gown; and when the
task I have given you is completed, go to the Castle and
keep your eyes open. There, if anywhere, trouble may
be looked for, and your ready wit will be most needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will at least let me be near you,&#8221; said Pascal
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your zeal and friendship too well to hesitate
to send for you at the first touch of danger. But I look
for none of any serious character. And now,&#8221; he broke
off, rising, &#8220;it is time for this visit to the Castle. I
must find Mademoiselle de Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle was waiting for him and again urged him
not to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a presentiment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let me dissuade
you at the last moment from this ill-omened daring.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;I should rather read the omens ill if I were to leave
you or suffer you to go alone, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there nothing I can say or do that will urge you
to fly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing; unless,&#8221; he added with a half-serious
smile&mdash;&#8220;unless you would share the flight. And
that I cannot ask&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started and looked to read his face, and after a
moment answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Malincourt, and my place, for good or ill, is
in Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is mine if not by your side?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, and they set out, Gabrielle
so chilled by a presentiment of danger that her look was
serious and troubled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>GABRIELLE&#8217;S FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Duke carried away from Malincourt a heart
bitter with jealousy and black with anger, and
he vented his passion upon de Proballe, whom
he chose to regard as the cause of all the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have betrayed my confidence shamefully. You
have doubtless your own ends to gain, as that letter
hinted; but they will cost you dear, whatever they are,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betrayed you? How?&#8221; asked de Proballe, exceedingly
uneasy as he thought his ulterior plans might be
suspected. &#8220;What have I done other than as we
agreed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did we agree that this scoundrel was so to arrange
the manner of his coming as to impress your niece in this
way? Was he to flaunt himself as a man of spirit and
courage and impose thus on a young, impressionable,
high-minded girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I order the manner of his coming? You wrong
me entirely. His secret coming was as much a surprise
to me as an offence to you; and that he was able to
make this impression on Gabrielle was not my doing
but the blundering of your own men. Your soldiers first
in the market place; your followers, de Cavannes and
d&#8217;Estelle, afterwards in their attack upon Denys in
Gabrielle&#8217;s very presence when Gerard was at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God they had killed him!&#8221; exclaimed the
Duke brutally. &#8220;But after the affair in the market place
you should have told me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Nay, that is an even greater injustice than ever.
Who of us even guessed that the man was de Cobalt?&#8221;
De Proballe&#8217;s tone was a good imitation of injured innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have betrayed me, I say; and if the thing miscarries
you shall suffer,&#8221; returned the Governor, in no
mood to listen to any reason. &#8220;You should have stopped
the mischief as soon as you saw it was going so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It happened but yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s Cross! man, what has that to do with it? Is
a mischief like this to be counted by hours? Was it ever
in our plan that the villain should win your niece&#8217;s
heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had at least to make such an impression as would
induce her to consent to marry him. It is but a passing
fancy which the proof of his evil character will cure&mdash;and
his flight will prove it better than aught else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Passing fancy!&#8221; exclaimed the Duke bitterly. &#8220;Are
you blind? I know not when I have so keenly suffered.
But if he do not fly, he shall suffer too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not fool enough to remain. It was a shrewd
thought to give him time to cool and think; and if he
have any mind to linger, I will find arguments to drive
him away. He has yet to learn your methods of justice
here in Morvaix: I can find in them ample reasons for
him. Although why you let him go instead of dealing
with him at once I do not see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he flies, his flight will be, as you say, the
proof of his guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will fly,&#8221; said de Proballe, confidently. &#8220;Did he
not shun your province as a man would shun hell? Did
he not refuse to come without that promise of pardon in
writing? By a man&#8217;s acts you shall know him, not by
his words. Let him think of Gabrielle as he will, he
will think more of his own life. But I would have kept
him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;When his flight has proved his guilt he can be retaken
for me to use.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe laughed. &#8220;You have a mercy of your
own, Duke. I had not thought of that. Stay, what if
he were to use this interval of your mercy to prevail
on Gabrielle to fly with him? He is daredevil enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would never stoop to that, surely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women are women, and when they are in&mdash;when a
man influences them, I mean, the best will do strange
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Return to Malincourt and watch, de Proballe. Your
niece is to come to the Castle two hours after noon. Make
this flight impossible after then; and after that I will
see to it that no chance offers for her to leave even the
Castle itself. If the mad attempt be made, have the
scoundrel seized and brought to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe was by no means sorry to get away from
the Governor in his present mood, and returned to
Malincourt to keep the watch; while the Governor hurried
on to the Castle to take further steps designed to
prevent this suggested flight; and some of them were to
have important results in another direction.</p>

<p>He despatched a body of soldiers to watch round
Malincourt, and at the same time sent urgent commands
to the officers of the different gates of the city that no
one was to be allowed to pass out without leave signed by
him. Thus it came about that the courier whom Pascal
was sending to Cambrai was stopped, and valuable time
lost.</p>

<p>The Governor, having completed these arrangements,
was closeted for an hour with his wife, and as soon as he
heard, to his intense relief, that Gabrielle had arrived at
the Castle and was with the Duchess, he sent for Dubois
to sound him in regard to that part of the plan which
called for the aid of the Church.</p>

<p>He was as hot now upon the scheme of divorcing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
wife in order to be free to marry again, as he had been
formerly upon the other intention.</p>

<p>The ruse by which Gerard had succeeded in getting
a hundred of his own soldiers enrolled among the Castle
troops, by pretending that they came as a gift from
the Cardinal Archbishop, was thus having singular
results. The Governor read it as a proof that he stood
so well with the Cardinal that he could hope to receive
his Eminence&#8217;s support in the matter of the divorce; and
as he concluded Dubois had been chosen as the Cardinal&#8217;s
delegate because of the latter&#8217;s confidence in him, here
was the very man at hand to sound on the matter.</p>

<p>Dubois was a clever soldier and a brave fighter, and
had been selected by Gerard for his present task because
his influence with the men was most likely to keep them
in bounds while in the Castle. He made a very brusque
unmonklike monk, however; and he now found himself
in a very awkward position. Moreover, he knew nothing
of Gerard&#8217;s experiences within the last few hours.</p>

<p>He listened quietly to the Duke, and, seeing no connection
between the matter and any of Gerard&#8217;s affairs,
felt no interest in it at all, and gave his own opinion
bluntly. He was a soldier, not a cleric; knew little and
cared less about the theological views as to the dissolution
of a tie cemented by a sacrament of the Church;
and the only thought he had about it was that as the
Tiger Governor was such a tyrant, it was a blessing and
not a curse that he was childless&mdash;the point on which
with him the Duke laid the chief stress.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Eminence would never sanction it, my lord,&#8221;
he declared brusquely. &#8220;It is against the Canon of
Holy Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it has been sanctioned before now,&#8221; replied the
Governor, and went on to cite instances and to argue
the matter. Dubois had, however, only one reply to
everything.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;The Cardinal would never sanction it;&#8221; and his
dogged insistence upon this began at length to enrage
the Governor, not a little to Dubois&#8217; grim amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have the countenance of the Church,
but in Morvaix I am the head of the Church as of all
else. I am wont to act first and inquire afterwards in
most things. It is simpler, and the end is the same. This
may be such a case. If I should seek your help as the
Cardinal&#8217;s representative you would give it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is none of my affair,&#8221; replied Dubois hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat my question;&#8221; and the Governor looked at
him meaningly. But Dubois was the last man in the
world to be browbeaten; and thus he answered stolidly:</p>

<p>&#8220;And I repeat my answer, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not wont to be set at defiance by monk or
priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I to be driven from my duty, my lord. I am
not setting you at defiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My priests in Morvaix do not answer me thus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not your lordship&#8217;s priest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will at least keep silence about what has passed
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless my duty demand that I should speak of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that but threatening me and defying me?&#8221;
The Governor&#8217;s anger was mounting fast in view of
what he deemed the monk&#8217;s contumacy, and Dubois was
no less dogged and blunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If what you propose to do be right, what need is
there for silence; if it be wrong, why should my lips be
sealed?&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Secrets confided to the ears of you holy men are to
be regarded as sacred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no such occasion. You sought my opinion
and I gave it. That is all. My duty is my duty, none the
less or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace with your canting about duty. You are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Morvaix now, and I will settle what is your duty. I
rule here, absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not disputing your rule, my lord; but I was
not sent here to do your bidding or to cease to do what
I deem my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of my sight. It is such canting hypocrites as
you who sow discord and do mischief. See to it that
you hold your babbling tongue, or I&#8217;ll find means to
silence you.&#8221; But Dubois fired at this injustice and answered
hotly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no canting hypocrite, my lord, nor am I a
recreant coward to flinch and cringe before your angry
looks and passionate words. They do but convince me
that in this thing you have some evil purpose; and not
in Morvaix, no, nor in all France, is there power to
silence me if I think I ought to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of my presence before I send for my guards
to drive you away for a pestilent ribald malcontent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came of your seeking, not of my own wish,&#8221; returned
Dubois, not one whit abashed by the Governor&#8217;s
violence.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have cause to send for you again you will
repent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no ways persuaded of that,&#8221; returned Dubois,
sturdily; and he swung out of the room, little thinking
that he had done harm to Gerard by his manful
attitude. Yet in a way he had; for the Governor,
revolving what had passed, determined not to take the
risk of applying to the Cardinal, but to hurry on his
marriage, and leave the Church to interfere when it
would have the accomplished fact to face.</p>

<p>Had Dubois but known, he would have been more
prudent to have appeared to consent to the Governor&#8217;s
plans and to have held out to him the hope of the
Cardinal&#8217;s consent, so that he might have been induced
to incur the delay necessary to obtain it. He saw this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
when Gerard pointed it out to him later. But it was
too late then.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Duchess had received Gabrielle
with even greater tenderness and love than usual; and
it was some time before she began to work round slowly
to the subject of the Duke&#8217;s wishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am old, feeble, and bed-ridden, Gabrielle, and
worse than all, childless. I am done with the world,
dear, and willing to give place to one who can play my
part better. It would have been better, far better, had
I died years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I should have lacked the truest woman friend
a girl could have,&#8221; answered Gabrielle sweetly. &#8220;But
you must not yield to this melancholy. You have been
in greater pain than usual, I fear, and it has tried you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of body, child, but of mind, perhaps,&#8221; and she
sighed. &#8220;It is ill to lag on and on, a weary dreary
nuisance to all around you. There comes a time when
it is good to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are morbid. Something has distressed you.
Tell me,&#8221; and Gabrielle sat on the bedside and took her
friend&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a failure, child. I see it now; and see
how the people under the Duke&#8217;s rule have suffered in
consequence. The Duke himself has shown me this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke?&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The influence of a woman&#8217;s hand in his governing
has been sadly missed. He loved me once, child, and
then I could sway him, hard though he now seems. But
when I bore him no children and my helplessness fell
on me, an estrangement grew between us and from that
followed, oh, so many evils.&#8221; She sighed deeply, and
paused before she added: &#8220;Yet he has shown me it is
not too late, even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot follow you now, dear,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;A noble without a son to succeed him lacks one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the great incentives to do right, Gabrielle. He turns
his thoughts inwards, broods, thinks only of himself, and
grows the harder for the galling grief and disappointment.
It has been so with the Duke. If I had but died
years ago, when first my calamity struck me down, he
would have taken another wife who would have borne
him children. Would God indeed that I had died!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle said nothing. Deep down in her mind the
thought began to take shape that there was some purpose
behind her friend&#8217;s words&mdash;some new cause to
bring this side of her sufferings to the light just now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to pray so earnestly for a son,&#8221; the Duchess
continued, after a painful pause; &#8220;but none came; and
I was thus so unneeded, so less than useless; a clog, a
drag, a dead weight in his life. I could not wonder he
grew cold, and that in time the coldness hardened into
cruelty. I stood for no more than the disappointment
in his life.&#8221; She spoke in a slow, leaden, hopeless,
melancholy tone, infinitely touching to Gabrielle. &#8220;It is a
dreary fate for a wife, child, to stir no other feeling in
her husband&#8217;s heart than that of disappointment and to
see it hardening slowly into hate. Had I but dared at
that time I would have taken my life. But I was a
coward. I dared not find freedom in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the Duke know of these thoughts?&#8221; asked Gabrielle,
keeping her face averted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether he could read mine as I could read his, I
know not. I saw him only rarely. This has been so for
many years indeed. That he should speak often of our
childlessness, should even taunt me with it, was perhaps
no more than natural&mdash;and yet every word was like a
sword-thrust in my heart. More than once I made
him a proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my own thought,&#8221; continued the Duchess,
smoothing Gabrielle&#8217;s hair and petting her. &#8220;Quite my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
own. You know how the idea of self-sacrifice will sometimes
seize upon us women till it becomes almost a desire.
It was so with me. I knew it would be so well for
Morvaix if he could have some one by his side, heart-warm
in the desire to help the people, strong in influence
to modify the ever growing sternness of his rule by
gentle suasive counsel&mdash;he is at heart a man amenable
to such influence, Gabrielle&mdash;and able to take a due part
in the work of government: a helpmeet in all ways. So
I urged him to gain the sanction of Holy Church to dissolve
our marriage, on the ground of our childlessness,
and seek&mdash;another and a better wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, my dear,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, intensely moved.
&#8220;Where could he find a better in all fair France than
you? He refused you, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;then; and not kindly, but with a gibe&mdash;that
he had not found marriage an experience he wished to
double. It wounded me of course to have what I meant
in all sincerity to be a help to him thus turned to jeering;
but he did not understand my motive, I think. But now
he has gone back to the plan; for there is one, a woman
among women, Gabrielle, who would be all that Morvaix
could desire as his wife. And the one of all others whom
I could best bear to see filling my place.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for Gabrielle to speak; but no response
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her heart, like mine, is for the people&#8217;s weal and her
influence would be far greater than mine could ever have
been with the citizens; real, powerful, active, where mine
is now dead. You have often told me how you love the
people, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must say no more,&#8221; answered Gabrielle, in a
low firm voice. &#8220;I will not affect to misunderstand you,
and I know you speak in all purity of thought and intent.
But were all other considerations naught, I would never
do you this wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;He and all would honour you if you were his wife,
Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I should dishonour myself. I beg you say no
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be all-powerful to rule in Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were the throne of France the guerdon I would not
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heart is free, child?&#8221; The gentle eyes were
full on Gabrielle&#8217;s face as the question was put, and the
light that rushed to it did not escape them. &#8220;Gabrielle,
my Gabrielle, I did not know;&#8221; and at that Gabrielle
lowered her head and hid it on her friend&#8217;s heart. &#8220;Pray
heaven he is worthy of you. Tell me, child. Or is it a
secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No secret,&#8221; said Gabrielle, lifting her head proudly.
&#8220;My cousin, Gerard de Cobalt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, not he, surely not he, I trust,&#8221; interposed
the Duchess, in a tone of dismay. &#8220;Oh, how I am
punished for not having spoken my fears. Since last we
spoke together of him and his coming, I have heard ill
tidings indeed concerning him, but put off speaking to
warn you until I could be certain. He is not worthy of
you, child; far, far from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not seen him and spoken with him, or you
would not say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did he come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But yesterday; or rather, two days past;&#8221; and
Gabrielle told of the meeting in the market place and
after at Malincourt.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a tragedy,&#8221; was the Duchess&#8217;s comment. &#8220;And
you love him! Oh, Gabrielle, Gabrielle, what sorrow is
there not in store for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not through him,&#8221; was the confident reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! child, what do you know of men who judge
them by a comely face and a fair-speaking tongue?
When could a man not speak a maiden fairly? Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
they not told you of his evil life? Of the crime for
which he craved the Duke&#8217;s pardon fore ever he set foot
in the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart is closed to the voice of slander against
him, dear,&#8221; replied Gabrielle, in the same proud confident
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;How like a maiden in love! But alas! my child, I
know these things are true. His life is forfeit for the
one deed&mdash;but one among many in his black life. Oh,
Gabrielle, how terrible, how terrible! It will break your
life even worse than mine has been broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have neither fears for him nor doubts for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the heart is young how easy to be confident.
How sad and more than sad is all this! And here, then,
is the reason why my words found your ears deaf, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in part. Had I never seen Gerard, my answer
had been the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess sighed and shivered slightly in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke will hear your decision unwillingly,
Gabrielle; and it will harden his heart against the man
who thus comes between you and him. Your cup of
suffering will be full indeed even while you are so young.
He had built upon this marriage; thinking by it to join
the influence of your house of Malincourt with his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recall now how he spoke of my having some influence
in the governing of the city, and of some sacrifice
to be made by me. This may have been in his thoughts;
and yet almost in the same breath he had spoken of my
marriage to my cousin. &#8217;Twas inexplicable to me then,
and is even more so now. Yet the thing was not more
possible then than now. Did death itself gape full in
front of me, I would not be his wife.&#8221; There was no
mistaking the unalterable firmness of her decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have an honest heart and soul, Gabrielle, and
were I you, and so placed as you, I should decide as
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;You uphold me, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told the Duke I was sure what your reply would
be when he laid on me the ungrateful task of questioning
you. Yet in a way I am sorry; for if it be not you, it
may be some one less worthy, to the hurt of all in
Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if need should come, you will stand by me as
to my cousin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I ever failed you when I had the power to
help? But in this I am powerless. It would be wrong
to give you fruitless hope. Were he but a good man,
worthy of your sweet pure love, how gladly would I
serve you, if serve any one I can in my helplessness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled. &#8220;I will prove him worthy&mdash;nay, not
I, he himself will prove it to Morvaix and the world;
and then I will claim your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor claim it in vain, Gabrielle; that you know. And
now let us speak of less trying matters. I am weary,&#8221;
said the Duchess, and they were thus engaged when the
Governor entered.</p>

<p>Gabrielle rose, and the Duke first cast a sharp questioning
glance at his wife&#8217;s face&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always glad to find you here, mademoiselle. I
trust you have had long enough time to come to an
understanding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done my utmost, Charles,&#8221; said the Duchess,
shrinkingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask no more. May I beg some words with you,
mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except on one subject, certainly,&#8221; replied Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will discuss the exceptions in private,&#8221; he
returned with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you to excuse me, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was characteristic. He opened the door
leading to an adjoining room and held it for her to
pass out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Pardon me my insistence. What I have to say must
be in private and cannot wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Gabrielle rebelled, raising her head
proudly and meeting his gaze firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat, must be in private, mademoiselle,&#8221; he said,
adding as an afterthought: &#8220;And it cannot fail to
interest you, seeing whom it concerns.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went then and he followed, maintaining silence
until they were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be no misunderstanding between us, my
lord,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, at once throwing down the gauge
of defiance. &#8220;The Duchess, your wife and my dear friend,
has at your instigation made me acquainted with your
proposal&mdash;a proposal I deem infamous and unholy&mdash;and
no power you can exert can bring me even to consider
it. I pray you spare me the pain of any further reference
to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong to meet me thus at the outset with
antagonism. You have heard as yet but one side only,
and must bear with me while I speak of the other. I am
far from being your enemy, Heaven knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While matters remain as they are, I cannot count
your lordship among my friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are hard words to hear, mademoiselle. You
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the slanders you have sanctioned against my
cousin and the threats with which you have menaced him.
His cause is mine; his enemies are my enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a stern, angry gesture, but held his temper
in check.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess has told you my wishes&mdash;that of her own
will and at her own desire our marriage should be dissolved,
in order that you may become my wife. But my
full motive she could not tell you because she does not
know it. It is&mdash;that I love you, Gabrielle; love, aye,
worship the very ground you tread and the very air you
breathe. For me all France holds no&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Spare me this added shame, my lord,&#8221; Gabrielle
broke in, her voice vibrating and her eyes flaming with
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame!&#8221; he repeated, with an angry start.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it but shame, the wrong you would do to
the purest and sweetest wife man ever had; what else
but shame that you should offer to prostrate your government
to your own purposes; what but foulest shame
that almost within hearing of the woman you would thus
wrong you seek to pollute my ears with this infamous
profession? If there be a spark of manhood in you,
kindle it till it light up your soul sufficiently to save you
and me from this unholy degradation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your passion but whets my love, Gabrielle. I am not
a man to be set aside from a purpose once formed. My
purpose is now set&mdash;you shall be my wife; and neither
man nor devil nor God shall turn me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have but one word, then. I hold your offer to be
vile and degrading, and I would rather die than falter
for an instant in repudiating it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not turn me,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I have offered
you my love&mdash;a love that burns in me as a consuming
fire&mdash;and you think to put it aside with indignation and
contempt. But there are other emotions fighting for me
than love. And fear is one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not fear your lordship,&#8221; flashed Gabrielle, with
lofty pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet there is none in Morvaix to protect you from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin Gerard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has fled the city, like the craven, guilty, worthless
wretch he is,&#8221; he answered contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not true, my lord. He is here in your castle.
He came with me, foreseeing more clearly than I the
purpose with which you brought me here. He came for
my protection. And he is no craven guilty wretch as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
you say, but a good and true man: the man, my lord,
whom I love, and whose wife I shall be, by the grace
of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood fighting with the tempest of rage which this
proud avowal provoked and was still striving for self-restraint,
when an interruption occurred. Some one came
to the door, and when, with an angry exclamation, he
opened it, he found a messenger from de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Grace, M. le Baron de Proballe desires me to
say that he seeks the favour of an immediate audience
with you on matters of the most urgent importance affecting
closely M. de Cobalt,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not fled, you say?&#8221; cried the Duke, turning
to Gabrielle, and jumping to the conclusion that that
was the news. His manner was full of exultation, and
he laughed unpleasantly as he added: &#8220;Come and see
for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they went down to where de Proballe was
waiting with strange news that had brought him in hot
haste to the Castle.</p>

<p>At the sight of her uncle&#8217;s face and the triumphant
glance he cast at her, Gabrielle felt her heart sink in
momentary fear for Gerard; but she rallied quickly and
faced them both with a confident smile as she waited
for the tidings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE Gabrielle was closeted with the Duchess
Gerard had made the best use of his time to
learn what he could of the Governor&#8217;s Castle.</p>

<p>Well placed on rising ground just within the northern
gate, it had in former times been a strong fortress, at
once overawing Morvaix itself and commanding the
approach from the north, the side which was most open
to attack. Its outer fortifications formed a long portion
of the boundary walls of the city; and in the more
desperate times when that district had been constantly
overrun by raiders, many a fierce and desperate conflict
had raged round its gloomy walls.</p>

<p>Gerard saw, not without uneasiness, that the Governor
had restored many of the old fortifications, had constructed
several more modern works, and had thus
greatly strengthened the place.</p>

<p>The reason was not far to seek. The Duke ruled by
force. He ground the people under the iron heel of
military discipline; and so long as he was sure of the
strength of his Castle and could maintain his soldiers,
the people were powerless. They might protest and
murmur and even rise in revolt; but under the frowning
menace of the Castle, they were helpless.</p>

<p>Every piece of the military machinery was kept in a
high state of preparedness for eventualities, and Gerard&#8217;s
keen soldier&#8217;s eye could not fail to note all the evidences
of strength and to estimate them at their true value.
Whatever the Duke might be, he was a good soldier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Everything about the Castle was regulated with military
precision.</p>

<p>Stranger though he was, no one attempted to interfere
with him or even hinder him as he made his observations.
He had been seen to arrive with Gabrielle, and
as the Duke had never deemed it possible he would
venture inside the fortress and had therefore given no
orders concerning him, he was held to be a guest who had
been made free of the Castle, and was allowed to go
where he would.</p>

<p>The knowledge gained in this survey might prove
invaluable. The plan of the whole Castle was soon clear
in his mind and he detected the one weak spot in the
defences against which, should the time come, an attack
could best be delivered.</p>

<p>This was at a point on the city side of the walls where
some works were still in progress. The ground outside
rose to within a few feet of the parapet on the top, and
gangs of men were at work there: some removing the
ground and others deepening the foundations of the
walls, while their ladders and tools lay about the place.</p>

<p>Gerard smiled with intense satisfaction at the discovery,
which might well have vital importance. If a
crisis arose which rendered it imperative for him to make
a stand against the Governor for a time while awaiting
the arrival of his cousin from Cambrai, Dubois could
easily collect the men within the Castle and with them
make a dash through this breach; or again, if he himself
were put under any restraint by the Duke, here was the
road of escape.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in his mind he made the most
careful observation of the exact position of the spot,
and then descended from the walls to the courtyards
below to find the speediest and most direct road to it.</p>

<p>He had completed his survey and was entering the
Castle when he encountered Dubois fresh from his interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
with the Governor and seething with indignation
at his treatment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord!&#8221; exclaimed Dubois involuntarily, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, holy friar,&#8221; answered Gerard, with a
gesture of caution. &#8220;I have heard of your good deeds
and would confer with you,&#8221; he added aloud for the
hearing of a couple of soldiers who were passing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can speak here,&#8221; said Dubois, drawing aside into
an alcove; and in rapid tones he told of all he had done
since his arrival, and then described the interview with
the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did well, but could have done better,&#8221; said
Gerard, after a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;You should have led
him to think the sanction would have been forthcoming
from the Cardinal, and so have gained time. But it is
vain to speak of that now. Listen to my plans.&#8221; He told
him the result of his observation, and instructed him to
ascertain exactly what guard was kept at the works by
night, to have some of their own men always watching
near at hand, and above all to be sure that ladders were
to be available there so that no time should be lost in
case of emergency.</p>

<p>&#8220;I too have a plan,&#8221; said Dubois. &#8220;The soldiers here
are but a wild mercenary lot, dissatisfied with everything;
disaffected toward the Duke and their officers; any man&#8217;s
men who will but pay them. With a few bags of crowns,
many of them could be bought and the Castle itself seized.
Even among those who could not be bought, the men of
Morvaix itself and the district round, there are many who
hate the Governor for his excesses and, in their sympathy
with the people outside, are ripe to revolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendidly done!&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;I knew you would
not be housed in the Castle without results. I like the
scheme. &#8217;Twould be a stroke indeed to vanquish this
strutting cock with his own spurs. Push your inquiries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
all you can in safety, using every discretion, and we will
speak of it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my fine cavalier, so we meet again. Seeking
absolution from our new sir priest here, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard turned quickly at the sneering voice to find
that the two gallants whom he had surprised in their
attack upon Denys, had come up unawares and now stood
regarding Dubois and himself with sharp suspicious
glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Duke dead that his serving men have come
to power?&#8221; retorted Gerard. &#8220;Or is either of you
minded to renew the affair of the gardens of Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are minded to see what the rats are about in
the Castle, whatever the colour of their coats.&#8221; It was
d&#8217;Estelle who answered. He was pale and weak, and
carried his arm in a sling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wounded, monsieur, and so licensed for a
time in your insolence. But you, monsieur,&#8221; and Gerard
made a step toward Antoine. &#8220;You are still unhurt.
Do you carry also an uncivil tongue? If I know not how
your tongue runs, since I have not heard it yet, I know
at least how your legs run, for I have seen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no brawler&#8217;s tavern,&#8221; cried d&#8217;Estelle, insolently.
&#8220;You are out of your element here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace,&#8221; interposed Dubois, in his sonorous tones.
&#8220;Be careful of such wanton provocation. I have known
men&#8217;s blood to flow for less. You should guard your
tongue, young sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, bald pate,&#8221; cried d&#8217;Estelle with a flippant
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have said nothing, monsieur,&#8221; said Gerard to
Antoine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, my son, peace,&#8221; said Dubois again, laying his
hand on Gerard&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Would you, too, provoke
strife?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;Good, old Tell-your-beads. What&#8217;s sauce for the
goose is sauce for such a gander,&#8221; exclaimed d&#8217;Estelle,
with another laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;These gentlemen and I have met before, father,&#8221; said
Gerard. &#8220;I prevented them from murdering a man, and
they bear me ill-will in consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was no murder but a fair quarrel, monsieur,&#8221; said
Antoine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair? With two swords to one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught M. St. Jean maltreating a lady who is dear
to me, and did but seek to punish him as he deserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I see a liar I watch his lips and listen. I am
watching yours, monsieur,&#8221; said Gerard, contemptuously.
&#8220;You were set to murder him and for that purpose rode
after him yester morning.&#8221; Antoine changed colour and
d&#8217;Estelle was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful what you say, monsieur,&#8221; replied Antoine,
hoarsely. &#8220;We are the Duke&#8217;s followers and this is his
lordship&#8217;s Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not like my words, monsieur, there is an
alternative which men of honour understand,&#8221; retorted
Gerard, in a deliberate tone, and with a look which
Antoine had little mind to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not seek a fight with you, it is not because
I fear you,&#8221; he answered, in none too firm a tone; &#8220;but
because there may be a way more useful to my master to
deal with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate your discretion, and should I need a
spy, may send in quest of your services.&#8221; Then turning
his back upon the pair he added to Dubois: &#8220;Now,
father, we will resume our discussion of that point about
Thomas &agrave; Kempis. I was arguing in regard to the
warning against apostasy that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those vermin may be dangerous. They suspect,&#8221; put
in Dubois as they passed out of earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;A risk or so more or less at this crisis does not count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
for much; but try to have them marked. They are two
of this Tiger&#8217;s claws and would scratch from behind
given the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a noise behind them attracted Gerard&#8217;s
attention, and turning he saw de Proballe, with Dauban
at his side, hurrying toward the apartments of the
Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Gerard, I find you in good company here!&#8221; said
de Proballe in a cordial tone, pausing on his way. &#8220;I
have great news. It concerns you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so, M. le Baron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a formal fellow you are, with your M. le Baron.
We must get to closer terms than these. I&#8217;m taking my
news to the Governor. Come with me. Give me your
arm, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, monsieur, but it is not my wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gerard, Gerard,&#8221; cried de Proballe, with a laugh.
&#8220;You will never push your way in this good city of
Morvaix while you show yourself so cold and indifferent.
Well, well, come to the Duke or go to the&mdash;Church your
own way. It&#8217;s all one to me,&#8221; and with a laugh he swept
on. He was in high spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some meaning in this,&#8221; muttered Gerard,
gazing after him. &#8220;Go you, Dubois, and see to all I
have said. I will make my way to the Duke. &#8216;When
de Proballe laughs there is the devil by his elbow,&#8217; was
once a proverb in Paris, and it may be just as true in
Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without appearing to hasten, he followed de Proballe,
keeping a wary eye for all things as he passed along, and
quickened his steps when he caught sight of the Governor
in the distance in conference with de Proballe,
while Gabrielle, her back toward him, was watching
them closely.</p>

<p>The Governor had come down in response to de Proballe&#8217;s
urgent message in the firm belief that the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
was that of Gerard&#8217;s flight and his first question was
to that effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A word first into your ear;&#8221; and de Proballe drew
him aside. &#8220;Gone? No, thank Heaven! better than
that, much better. He is here in the Castle. I have
spoken to him this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he dared?&#8221; exclaimed the Governor with a
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dared? It seems he would dare anything. Wait,
here he is,&#8221; he cried, catching sight of Gerard. &#8220;Now
you shall see a comedy. Come, Gerard, come; I was
waiting for you. I want your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing of his presence Gabrielle turned and ran to
Gerard and stood by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; demanded the Governor of de
Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear with me and have your guards at hand, and
you will see,&#8221; was the whispered reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are always at hand here,&#8221; was the curt grim
reply.</p>

<p>De Proballe went toward Gerard, a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have not followed our advice, Gerard, and
fled. You like the city and the Castle? Perhaps you
were seeking ghostly advice just now from that sturdy
monk? I found our young friend in close consultation
with a monk as I passed, Duke. Preparing, let us think,
for that longer journey which you mentioned as the alternative
to flight from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe was obviously enjoying the situation and
resolved to make the most of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the monk? Do you know him?&#8221; asked the
Governor quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He who came from the Cardinal Archbishop, the
delegate. Gerard, it seems, is particular as to who shall
shrive him. Our Morvaix priests are not good enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
The conference lasted long, too; at least so Antoine de
Cavannes told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor shot a sharp glance at Gerard, who said
to Gabrielle&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The monk is one of those whom I met two days ago
in the market place, Gabrielle, when Babillon, the smith,
was done to death at my lord&#8217;s bidding.&#8221; He spoke
quietly and calmly. &#8220;You may remember him; a dark,
swarthy, burly man who helped you. The companion of
him who stepped between us and the soldiery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember him well,&#8221; answered Gabrielle. She was
oppressed by a sense of danger, impalpable and invisible,
but yet real.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all,&#8221; said Gerard, with a smile to reassure
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what spoke you together?&#8221; asked the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;May not a man speak even with a monk in Morvaix
without the Governor&#8217;s permission? &#8217;Twould seem not
indeed; for even while we were in converse, those two
jackals who sought to take your Denys&#8217; life, Gabrielle,
came up with flouts and jeers and sneers, as though
licensed to insult even men of a religious life. I think in
truth this is a matter that concerns you closely, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you say that to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What daring is there in it? I answered the fellow&mdash;the
one that is yet unwounded&mdash;told him my thoughts
of him and offered him such reparation as he could take;
when he turned upon me and hinted that such insolence
as his was possible by your protection and permission.
He is yonder; let him come and answer for himself;&#8221;
and Gerard pointed to where Antoine and d&#8217;Estelle were
standing at a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this insolence,&#8221; exclaimed the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I told him,&#8221; replied Gerard coolly; &#8220;scarce believing
it possible such things could be done with your
sanction.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>De Proballe had been fretting at this interlude in which
he was not taking the important part he desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need a curb to your tongue, Gerard,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does M. de Proballe desire an opportunity of applying
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fire-eater it is!&#8221; cried de Proballe, hiding
his vexation under a laugh, &#8220;and what a wit! Where
did you learn to be so free with your tongue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in Morvaix of a truth, where every one must
order his speech to suit the ears of his Governor, it
seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard!&#8221; whispered Gabrielle, with growing alarm
at his reckless answers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet there are things in Morvaix that we can teach
persons of even your high character!&#8221; exclaimed the
Governor sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already learnt many, my lord,&#8221; was the dry
retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;One you will learn. Thou shalt do no murder,&#8221; added
de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is certainly a branch of knowledge with many
expert professors here,&#8221; returned Gerard, with the same
reckless air.</p>

<p>His manner was intentionally assumed. He had not
failed to discern from de Proballe&#8217;s manner that some
development was at hand, which boded danger; and he
chose deliberately the attitude of reckless defiance of
all authority. Intrepid by nature, he had often seen
danger met and difficulties overcome by boldness, when
no other means could have succeeded.</p>

<p>His bearing toward the Governor, despot though he
was in Morvaix, was carefully calculated. As a Bourbon
and the son of the Suzerain Duke, with full authority to
act in his father&#8217;s place, this Governor owed him
allegiance, and he believed he had but to reveal his true
character to bring the bully to his knees.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Moreover, his hot Bourbon blood was fired by the
insults heaped upon him as well as by the infamous
condition of affairs he had found in Morvaix.</p>

<p>But above all, and more than all, his chivalry was
stirred on Gabrielle&#8217;s account; and his new-born love
for her filled his heart with fury against the two men
who had plotted her ruin and had turned their venom
against him only when they found he was no pliant tool
in their abominable scheme.</p>

<p>The Governor on his side was no whit less angry, and
only Gabrielle&#8217;s presence had restrained him from replying
to Gerard&#8217;s taunts with violence. He meant to use
Gerard as the means to force her consent to marry him;
and had resolved that he should not leave the Castle until
that consent had been wrung from her.</p>

<p>This very resolve, however, made him hesitate. To
give him countenance with her, the crime which Gerard
had committed must be the ground for imprisonment;
and while he smarted and fumed and raged under the
lash of Gerard&#8217;s bitter words, he had held back. But the
limit of his endurance was reached; and as a first step
he resolved to send Gabrielle away.</p>

<p>There was a pause of some moments after Gerard&#8217;s
last words while the Governor made this decision, and
then he turned to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, I must ask you to return to my wife
for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not go, Gabrielle, there is no need,&#8221; declared
Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is right, my lord, there is no need,&#8221; said de
Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must end,&#8221; muttered the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall end&mdash;now. Come, Gerard, I have spoken of
your sharp wits. Let us see you use them now. Tell me
the contents of this,&#8221; and de Proballe held a paper before
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;I am no wizard to read what I cannot see, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wizard; you hear that, Duke. No wizard. Yet
something of a wizard surely&mdash;to <i>write</i> what you have
never seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard on the instant understood what had occurred,
but his face gave no sign and he stared steadily into de
Proballe&#8217;s sneering face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Gerard, come. You must know it. It is your
own letter just arrived from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor understood it now, and with evidences
of great excitement he tore the paper from de Proballe&#8217;s
hand and read it.</p>

<p>He glanced from it to Gerard, and smiled&mdash;a smile full
of sinister meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you say you do not know this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard maintained the same calm collected attitude.
He was considering what course to adopt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear? Either you know what is written here or
you are some lying impostor masquerading in a false
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard! Gerard!&#8221; cried Gabrielle, intensely moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, Gerard&mdash;or some other name,&#8221; sneered de Proballe.
&#8220;Ask his name, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, monsieur, at once if you please,&#8221; said the
Governor, in a stern imperative tone. &#8220;Speak, or I call
my guards. Do you know this paper? If not, who are
you and why are you here?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>&#8220;I AM NOT GERARD DE COBALT&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF all present Gabrielle was by far the most
agitated. The Duke, perplexed, suspicious, and
bitterly hostile to the man who had stepped between
him and his passion, was chiefly concerned to find
how best to turn the thing to his rival&#8217;s hurt. De Proballe,
angry at having been tricked, was for the moment
too occupied in enjoying his personal importance in
having thus unmasked the impostor, to think of much
else.</p>

<p>But to Gabrielle the issue was all in all. If this were
not Gerard her cousin, the man to whom she had been
betrothed, how strangely forward and unmaidenly she
must have appeared. She recalled with a sense of something
akin to shame how she had almost pressed herself
upon him in the first moment of his arrival; and at the
recollection, her cheeks flamed so that she hid them
beneath her hands and involuntarily drew away from his
side.</p>

<p>It was but a little thing, that gesture of hers; but
Gerard saw and understood it, and on the moment it
stayed the words of avowal even as they were at his
lips, and changed the whole course of his action. He
had come to Morvaix to ascertain the truth as to the
misgovernment and, if need arose, to depose and punish
the powerful Governor; but his love for Gabrielle was
now so much to him and filled so much of his purpose,
that he set it first and before all else.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>He had won her love by a trick, an imposture. He had
been in great measure forced into it by circumstances,
indeed, and by his very zeal in her cause. But it was
none the less a trick; and he was too proud, having won
it so, to hold it by mere greatness of rank. He would
not avow that rank until he had justified himself in
Gabrielle&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>And even as he thought of this and formed the resolve,
another consideration occurred to him. He could by
this means still further test the methods of rule in
Morvaix. He had had ample evidence of the Governor&#8217;s
willingness to wrest the considerations of justice
to his own personal ends; but it would throw a fresh
light upon matters to note his conduct when he knew that
the man he had first used and then threatened was not
the cowardly murderer the real Gerard de Cobalt was
said to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to trifle all day with me?&#8221; demanded
the Governor, when Gerard had remained silent some
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not trifling, but thinking,&#8221; answered Gerard. At
his calm strong tone Gabrielle took her hands from her
face and with another eager, almost imploring glance,
made a half step toward him, and then checked herself in
deep embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have need to think, I&#8217;ll warrant,&#8221; exclaimed de
Proballe.</p>

<p>But it was to Gabrielle Gerard turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no need to shrink from me, mademoiselle,&#8221;
he said with a smile, &#8220;although I can understand you.
I fear I must plead guilty to having deceived you. I am
not the writer of that letter. I am not your cousin,
Gerard de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see that game is over,&#8221; sneered de Proballe.
&#8220;What lie next, pray? You will not find us so easy to
be fooled now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;If I am not Gerard de Cobalt, monsieur,&#8221; cried
Gerard, sternly, &#8220;you will still find I am a man who does
not take insults lightly. For your past words I forgive
you, because of your natural irritation at this discovery.
But for your future words and conduct I shall hold you
responsible&mdash;every word and every act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will of course explain your conduct, monsieur,
and state as frankly as you can who you are and your
purpose in my city. See to it that the explanation be as
satisfactory as your present position is equivocal.&#8221; The
Governor&#8217;s tone was curt and peremptory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation is due to Mademoiselle de Malincourt,
and I promise you it shall be frank enough in some
respects to satisfy even you. I had a sufficient object in
coming to Morvaix&mdash;what that is for the present I withhold&mdash;and
to accomplish it I took a name not my own.
I borrowed it at hazard from a notorious dicer and
wastrel of Paris&mdash;Raouf de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you called yourself Gerard de Cobalt,&#8221; said the
Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;In ignorance that he had a relative of that name&mdash;an
even worse scoundrel, it would seem, than himself&mdash;whom
you and M. de Proballe designed to use for your
schemes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think to carry off this imposture with insolence?&#8221;
demanded the Duke angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not insolence. I have no cause to hide the
truth, monsieur. I had been in Morvaix but a few hours
when I was a witness of the scene in the market place,
and we met for the first time, mademoiselle. I inquired
concerning you, and learning that you were the Gabrielle
de Malincourt whose praises were on all men&#8217;s lips, I
haunted the gardens of the maison in the hope of seeing
you again. There we met, yesterday, for the second
time&mdash;and you may remember my passing confusion
when you questioned me as to the reasons for what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
seemed such strange conduct in a man you believed to
be your cousin and for whose coming you were prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not tell me all, monsieur,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know why. I was on the point of doing
so when M. de Proballe interrupted us, and carrying me
away, told me enough to disclose to me the peril which
threatened you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, we know all about that,&#8221; interposed de
Proballe hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle de Malincourt does not. You read the
letter yesterday of which your follower Denys had in
some way possessed himself, mademoiselle, and I need
only say that that contained in essence the story of this
de Cobalt which M. de Proballe told me at length, adding
that my marriage with you was to be no more or less
than a cover for your ruin at the hands of the Duke de
Rochelle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie,&#8221; cried the Governor furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then blame the liar, M. le Duc. There he stands,&#8221;
and Gerard pointed at de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a tissue of lies,&#8221; said de Proballe. &#8220;You know
me too well, Gabrielle, to believe this vile slander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you mistake. It is I, not Mademoiselle de
Malincourt, who know you. I know M. de Proballe&#8217;s
life and reputation in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This shall go no further. Your name, monsieur?&#8221;
demanded the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does not touch the truth or falsehood of what I say,
and need not therefore be disclosed yet. I shall choose
my own time to disclose it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell it now, or suffer the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand. Do you threaten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your own confession you have come sneaking here
in an assumed name; as a spy of some sort. We soldiers
have a short shrift for spies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Gabrielle, in a tone of entreaty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
alarmed for Gerard&#8217;s safety, and a prey to many
mingled emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have committed no offence, mademoiselle, save in
having misled you to believe I was a worse man than
I am. For that I have to crave your pardon, pleading
only in excuse the reasons I have shown. For the rest,
I have done no wrong,&#8221; he said, meeting confidently the
Governor&#8217;s threatening looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a spy, monsieur, and as a spy shall be
treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no uncommon thing for strangers to travel without
disclosing their names. Is that a crime in Morvaix
which is a common practice all over France and Europe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you say now you are naught but a traveller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far from it. I have a purpose in coming to your
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are a spy, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no spy, monsieur. I am a soldier. A true son
of France with none but pure French blood in my veins;
and a loyal subject of His Majesty the King, of whom
we are all subjects in common. I have fought under the
great Bourbon, the Suzerain of this city and the territory
of Morvaix. To hold me for a spy will argue ill of
Morvaix and the rule that prevails here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dare to threaten me, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur has doubtless his papers to support his
statements and a safe conduct from his powerful friends,&#8221;
suggested de Proballe, with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, of course, produce them,&#8221; declared the Governor.
&#8220;They may explain the suspicious manner of
your coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make good my words at any time,&#8221; said Gerard,
not relishing this thrust. &#8220;The manner of my coming
was my own choosing. But since I have been here your
lordship must have seen for yourself my acts have been
far from those of a spy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>De Proballe stepped forward and whispered eagerly to
the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so, indeed? I hear that even now you have
been seen making careful observations of our Castle and
the fortifications. You can of course explain so singular
and apt a curiosity? Apt, I mean, as fitting with the
conduct of a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the soldiers of France forbidden even to look at
the fortifications of Morvaix&#8217;s famous Castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spies are so forbidden, monsieur, and when detected
are dealt with as you, being a soldier, will understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat, I am no spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then prove it so, by declaring who you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am accustomed to have my word accepted, monsieur,&#8221;
answered Gerard proudly.</p>

<p>The Governor was about to answer when de Proballe
laid a hand on his arm and drew him to one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not declare yourself, monsieur?&#8221; asked Gabrielle,
half-hesitatingly, as the others drew out of earshot.
&#8220;You little know the Duke if you think you can safely
hold him at defiance thus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not concerned for what he may think or do,
mademoiselle. It is you, and you only, whom I fear to
have estranged. I deceived you. Can you forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have done it, monsieur,&#8221; she answered,
dropping her eyes. &#8220;You&mdash;you shamed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid you should believe such a thought as that
could have been in my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I deemed you were my cousin. Oh, when I
think of it, my face flames with humiliation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then in all truth am I bitterly punished. But you
must see how hardly I was placed. When I heard the
blunt confession of all that was designed against you I
knew not what to do. Hating myself for every act and
word of compelled deception, yet I could not speak without&mdash;&mdash;But
of course, you must blame me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;You could have told <i>me</i>, monsieur, if you had trusted
me;&#8221; and the reproach in her eyes as she glanced up
stung him so that he winced.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you read in me no more than mistrust?&#8221; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you think I have been untrue to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; This time with a little accent of pain,
adding under her breath, &#8220;I trusted you so completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; His tone was as low as hers, and when
she made no answer he said, &#8220;First your words stabbed
me, now it is your silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath and lifted and let fall her hand
with a gesture of perplexity: a pathetic little sign of
her distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, too, are silent&mdash;still,&#8221; she murmured, after
a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was so sure of you.&#8221; The softly spoken words
stung her so that she winced at the implied reproach in
them. The reproach was unmerited, and while repudiating
the injustice she was both wistful and yet unwilling
to let him see how his words hurt her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you not speak and end the uncertainty?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;For myself and for others I care nothing, as I say;
but can <i>you</i> find no reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for me?&#8221; she cried quickly, with a swift glance
and an involuntary thrill of delight. She had not
doubted him; but the confirmation of her trust which
seemed to come from the assurance that it was still for
her he was acting thus, brought inexpressible comfort.
If it was for her that he still ran the risks involved in
maintaining silence, it could be for only one reason.</p>

<p>He had been acting a part, and yet not acting merely
with her. The words he had spoken, the glances he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
cast, the thousand little acts and signs he had given while
she had deemed him her cousin, had expressed real feeling.
He had not looked on her as unmaidenly, but&mdash;and
as the thought grafted itself more firmly upon her faith
in him, the colour came flooding again to her cheeks, but
from such different causes, and her eyes glowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said, about to give impulsive
utterance to her new belief, when she checked herself,
looked up with a smile of sweet confusion, and then again
dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>Gerard had watched her closely trying to read the
perplexing changes of her manner, fearing from her constraint
and silence that she was angered; but gathered
hope fast when she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would give much to know that thought,&#8221; he said,
when she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not keep silence and run this risk for me,&#8221;
she said slowly, keeping her eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I forgiven the deception I practised?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it not done because you deemed it best for&mdash;for
all things?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had meant to say &#8220;for me,&#8221; but the words hung
on her lips so that she could not utter them.</p>

<p>&#8220;For all things, no,&#8221; he answered pointedly, &#8220;for
you, yes; for you only.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was sweet hearing. Her heart beat fast and her
bosom rose and fell quickly in agitation. But she could
not look at him, could not let him see yet how deeply he
had stirred her. She had passed one crisis of racking
pain when she feared that she had mistaken him; and
shrank now from even a chance of misjudgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that,&#8221; she said simply after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am forgiven?&#8221; he pressed, eager for her to
look at him, that he might read in her sweet eyes the
knowledge for which his heart was hungering.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; It was a whisper, no more; and still she kept
her eyes down.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you trust me as ever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may?&#8221; she questioned in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;As God is my judge you may,&#8221; he answered with
intense passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I forgive if I did not trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and was lifting her face to meet his ardent
gaze, when the Governor and de Proballe returned.</p>

<p>Neither Gerard nor Gabrielle had had eyes or ears for
them in the minutes of absence; and had not noted how
at first they had talked together and had then sent for
the two men, Antoine de Cavannes and d&#8217;Estelle, and
having questioned them, had once again conferred alone.</p>

<p>It was de Proballe who now took the chief part, and
he approached Gerard with a bland smile upon his
sallow face, and said, in a smooth even tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord has now committed this matter to my hands,
Gerard, as a family affair; and I am confident it can be
easily arranged.&#8221; Gerard noticed the use of his name
and the familiar manner, and read in it at once some
change of purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish your interference, monsieur, and
recognize no right of yours to take any such part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am acting solely in Gabrielle&#8217;s interest. I have put
it to the Duke that this matter can best be settled between
us. You see, Gerard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by the use of that name to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not your name Gerard?&#8221; He put the question
casually and with just the necessary accent of surprise.
&#8220;You must see how equivocal the position is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to hold no intercourse with you, monsieur,&#8221;
replied Gerard coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are really making a bad matter worse,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
de Proballe spread out his hands deprecatingly. &#8220;You
are either Gerard de Cobalt or some one else. If the
former, then this is a family matter which the Duke, in
his love of justice and regard for the honour of our
family, is willing to see arranged. But if the latter, then
your conduct throughout is open to great suspicion. You
came to the city secretly; you took part in our private
affairs without the faintest warrant; you led a violent
revolt against the Governor&#8217;s soldiers; you have wounded
one of his followers&mdash;most unjustifiably; you have forced
your way into the Castle here and, if not actually a spy,
have acted just as a spy would have acted; you have been
watched and observed to be in long confidential conference
with another stranger&mdash;some pestilent contumacious
monk; and thus have so gravely compromised
yourself as to strain the Duke&#8217;s clemency beyond endurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all this harangue means&mdash;what?&#8221; asked Gerard,
bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are in a very ugly fix indeed, in which my
influence with the Duke can only with difficulty assist
you. The monk with whom you spoke has been placed
in confinement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right in one thing, M. de Proballe: I can
read in this your influence with the Governor. But those
who know you best know that never yet did your influence
harm those against whom it was directed nor help
those for whom it was cast.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a servant approached Gabrielle with a
request that she would go at once to the Duchess. She
had been taken ill suddenly and had asked urgently for
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not hesitate on account of me,&#8221; said Gerard
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;These soldiers here,&#8221; replied Gabrielle in a tone of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
alarm, as she pointed to a number of men who showed
in the doorways. &#8220;See. I fear danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the hour for the change of guard, Gabrielle,&#8221;
said de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not go yet,&#8221; she declared firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot stay here, mademoiselle,&#8221; interposed the
Governor bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will report to you all that passes, Gabrielle,&#8221; said
de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not go,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better,&#8221; urged Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be as you will,&#8221; said de Proballe, when she
shook her head resolutely. &#8220;Now that the men are here
they will see that no violence is done. Our Gerard is so
hasty, such a fire-eater, that he might be tempted to some
fresh rashness which would be fatal to all settlement.
Wait,&#8221; he said as if struck with a sudden thought. &#8220;It
will serve the same purpose if you will give me your
sword, Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will never do,&#8221; was the quick indignant response.</p>

<p>&#8220;To me then, monsieur,&#8221; said the Governor, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;To no man, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must be taken from you;&#8221; and the Governor
signed to the soldiers.</p>

<p>In a moment Gerard&#8217;s blade was out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize what you are doing, and where you
are?&#8221; cried de Proballe. &#8220;Drawing upon the Governor
of Morvaix?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dares to lay a hand on me may look to himself.
I see your plan, monsieur,&#8221; said Gerard to de Proballe,
with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Disarm him,&#8221; commanded the Governor, his eyes
flashing. &#8220;This is treason against the constituted ruler,
monsieur.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Gerard, Gerard!&#8221; cried Gabrielle in dire alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Gabrielle, you must not interfere in this,&#8221; and
de Proballe seized her hand and drew her aside.</p>

<p>Gerard sprang forward to interfere, but the soldiers
interposed and prevented him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut him down if he resists,&#8221; was the Governor&#8217;s command,
implacably given.</p>

<p>For some moments the fierce unequal combat raged,
and two of the soldiers being wounded, the others fell
back for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, stop this fighting,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, struggling
to free herself from de Proballe&#8217;s grasp.</p>

<p>At her voice Gerard turned and made as if to go to
her, but the soldiers, seeing that his eyes were turned
from them, chose the moment to rush in again and one of
them sprang upon him from behind. Thus hampered
he was soon overpowered by the number who attacked
him, his sword was wrenched from his grasp, and he was
led away a prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>A PRISONER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GABRIELLE witnessed the attack upon Gerard
with almost breathless fear lest he should be
wounded or even killed in the fight; but when she
saw him led away a prisoner every feeling was merged
in fierce hot resentment at the outrage.</p>

<p>De Proballe retained his hold of her until Gerard had
been taken away, and the instant he released her she
turned upon him in magnificent indignation, she drew
herself to her full height and looked at him with eyes
flashing with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have shown me your true character at last,
M. le Baron, and from this point our roads part, and we
are strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it for your own good, Gabrielle,&#8221; he said
apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did it because I am only a woman. Were I a
man you should pay the penalty here and now. But there
are those in my household who will not tamely see me
maltreated, and if you consult your safety you will avoid
Malincourt. If you come there, I will have you driven
from my door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very angry and therefore very unreasonable.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her back upon him without a word more
and approached the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the moment you have your way, M. le Duc; but
the day has not yet dawned when the influence of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
house of Malincourt stands for naught in Morvaix. You
have foully outraged an innocent and honourable man,
and if I have to carry my appeal in person to the King
of France, I will have justice done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see you later, mademoiselle, when your indignation
has somewhat spent itself and you can better
appreciate what has occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My indignation will never pass, my lord, until justice
has been done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Justice will be done, mademoiselle; have no fear on
that score. What you have witnessed is but the needful
preliminary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean is justice according to the laws of
France, and not according to the Tyrant of Morvaix,&#8221;
she cried fearlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your present mood, I have no more to say;&#8221; and
with a bow he moved away, leaving Gabrielle free to go
where she would.</p>

<p>Remembering the message which had been brought to
her and eager to have some one to whom she could pour
out the tale of her wrongs and on whose sympathy she
could rely, Gabrielle went to the apartments of the
Duchess.</p>

<p>The two men watched her go, both moved by widely
different feelings. Each had been much disturbed by her
outburst.</p>

<p>De Proballe, thinking naturally of himself, was disposed
to regret the part he had taken. With the doors of
Malincourt shut against him he saw the plans for his own
future advancement in danger of collapse. He had meant
to climb on Gabrielle&#8217;s favour with the Duke to greater
things. For this reason he had welcomed the change of
plan which was to make her the Duke&#8217;s wife, and had
thrown himself readily into the attempts to ruin Gerard
in her eyes. But if he was to be deprived of the prestige
which the Malincourt influence afforded, he would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
left dependent only on his own wits and the Duke&#8217;s
favour; and what a shifting sand the latter was, he knew
only too well.</p>

<p>But the Governor was scarcely less furious than Gabrielle
herself, and never being inclined to blame himself
laid the whole fault upon de Proballe.</p>

<p>Gabrielle&#8217;s fierce resentment had shown the mistake of
attacking Gerard in her presence; and the fact that he
himself had given the orders only heightened his rage
against de Proballe. He left the latter no reason to misunderstand
his attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to be an outcast, it seems, because of this,&#8221; said
de Proballe, in as nonchalant an air as he could assume.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a man blunders as you have he has no cause
to quarrel with the consequences,&#8221; was the blunt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for that, I am too old a hand to quarrel when the
luck&#8217;s against me. But what blunder do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! I might have expected it,&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe,
with a sharp glance at the Governor&#8217;s angry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your plan. Had I not listened to you, matters
would have gone very differently. When you learnt that
the man was another than this Gerard de Cobalt, you
should have given me the information privately and have
left me to act. But you must needs meddle in it your own
way&mdash;and this is the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I know you would bring Gabrielle down to listen
to it all? The mischief is that the man was arrested before
her eyes. All women are hysterical fools at such
times. But at least it was not I who ordered your men to
attack him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe&#8217;s reply was a significant shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to give me the lie, monsieur?&#8221; cried
the Governor passionately.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;You had no hesitation about giving it me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; A sneer this, of ineffable contempt, and de
Proballe winced and bit his lip as his sallow cheeks paled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried to serve you in this,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had your wages to earn, that is all. Even this
man knew of your old character in Paris. Do you think
I am ignorant of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The taunt cut deep, but de Proballe forced down his
temper and answered with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put not your faith in princes,&#8221; he said, lightly. &#8220;If
you mean that having first used me and now abused me
you have no further need of my services, say so, and
we&#8217;ll make an end of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no use for blunderers like you,&#8221; declared the
Duke, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grant that a blunder has been made&mdash;as of course it
has&mdash;and say if you like that I made it; whether is it
better to waste time in wrangling over it or to see how
to repair it?&#8221; He paused a moment to note how this
was taken, and then added: &#8220;At least you have the man
safe under bolts and bars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in doing it have changed your niece&#8217;s passive
resistance into active violent hatred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if it comes to that, it would never have been
a love match on her side;&#8221; and he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with your sneers,&#8221; cried the Governor
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life&#8217;s too sour a thing to be taken so seriously. I
meant no taunt; no more than a fact. You would have
had to force it; and will have to do no more now. Her
rage will cool. As I say, you have the man and can treat
him at will, either as the scamp de Cobalt or the spy I
was able to prove him. Give her some few hours to
think over his danger, and then see how far she&#8217;ll be
ready to go to save his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can the fellow be?&#8221; De Proballe took heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
at the question. He was not going to be thrown overboard
at once; and he answered with gathering assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, rather, what does it matter who he is? He
came here as Gerard de Cobalt; he owned it to me; I can
swear to that. Treat him as no other. I called him by
his name that your people might hear; what I said to you
before the arrest stands as good now as then&mdash;deal with
him for that murder at Cambrai. You have him tight
enough by that rope and can answer his repudiation by
simply disbelieving it and regarding it as made when he
found himself in a mess. Gerard de Cobalt he was, and
Gerard de Cobalt I should let him remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is he? And what does he here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no persuasive methods in this Castle of
yours? I have heard that many a prisoner has before
now been led to confess his crime and so save an infinite
amount of trouble in collecting proofs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind misgives me,&#8221; murmured the Governor
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s Gabrielle&#8217;s influence;&#8221; and de Proballe
smiled, not pleasantly. &#8220;This is no woman&#8217;s work,
Duke.&#8221; He felt that his words were beginning to have
influence again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he be, as I suspect, a spy, in what interest is
he here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even spies can be induced to speak in old Pierre&#8217;s
chamber. Have him placed there, and you and I can
visit him later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I seek your advice where to place my prisoners?&#8221;
asked the Governor, angrily. &#8220;But I will have him sent
there,&#8221; he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and de Proballe smiled again cunningly. &#8220;All
will soon be well again, then, and this little mistake made
good. Few men can long resist the creaking arguments
of the rack.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor was silent long enough for de Proballe
to think of another scheme.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;There is, of course, another way. The lever you have
with Gabrielle is this precious fellow&#8217;s life and safety,
and if he chanced to get maimed in the progress of inquiry,
she would take it very ill. Promise her his life if
she will consent to marry you at once. Then send him
out of the city&mdash;with an escort. Escorts have been known
to quarrel with their charges before now,&#8221; he added drily.
&#8220;This man, if he be in truth a spy, may be dangerous.
There is that monk, too, who should also be put to the
question. Perchance he knows all that you need to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had forgotten him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not, and one man is as good as another when
it comes to getting information. Leave this to me, Duke.
I shall not blunder again. Meanwhile, you can go to
Gabrielle with a free hand, to give her any assurances
she may ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will speak of it later; I must think,&#8221; said the
Governor.</p>

<p>De Proballe looked after him as he walked away, and
laughed softly to himself. &#8220;What a cauldron of trouble
does this plaguey love brew for us fools of mortals!&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Here are the whole affairs of a city tumbled
topsy-turvy, hither-thither, because Gabrielle has a
pretty face and yonder sour-visaged loon is sick to kiss
it. Aye, aye, and blood will flow too, and men&#8217;s pates
will be cracked and their throats slit before his heart
ceases to ache, or I am no reader of signs; and &#8217;twill be
luck more than judgment that will carry one safe
through the hurly-burly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gabrielle had carried her storm of wrath
to the Duchess and had poured out her story with half-incoherent
vehemence until her friend, whose sudden
faintness had been invented by de Proballe as a lure to
get Gabrielle away, was like to be overcome in truth.</p>

<p>But even a girl&#8217;s wrath, however righteous, cannot
last for ever; and thus in time Gabrielle&#8217;s began to abate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
its hurricane force, and gradually her furious indignation
hardened into a stern determination to secure Gerard&#8217;s
freedom and to thwart and punish those who had so maltreated
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been so vehement, child, I could scarce
understand you,&#8221; said the Duchess. &#8220;I know how it
eases trouble to give it free vent; and so I would not interrupt
to get you to clear the tangled skeins for me. But
now let us see what we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am nearly mad when I think of it,&#8221; cried Gabrielle.
&#8220;If this shameful deed is not prevented, I believe I
shall go mad indeed. If aught of harm comes to him,
I will spend my life in avenging him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now tell me, who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know nor do I care. For me he is the best,
the bravest, and the noblest man that ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess smiled, but did not let Gabrielle see the
smile. She loved the girl dearly, and her heart was still
young enough to sympathize even with such a rhapsody.
But the contrast between this whirlwind mood and
Gabrielle&#8217;s former calm and unmoved indifference to all
men, and especially to all lovers, was too startling not
to appeal to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should have proclaimed himself, Gabrielle, and
then all this trouble might have been spared.&#8221; This was
good common sense, but love and youth are contemptuous
of common sense. To Gabrielle it savoured of distrust
of Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did rightly. He could not do wrong, Duchess,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;His motive was nobleness itself. We drove
him into assuming my cousin&#8217;s part; he did it for my
sake and mine only; and he could not make himself
known in his own name until he had justified himself
in my eyes. You would not have had him do otherwise.
I would not, not for a thousand worlds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been less romantic, but very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
simpler, my dear child,&#8221; was the practical reply, very
kindly spoken. &#8220;But we have to deal with the matter as
it stands. Tell me why did the Duke have him placed
under arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For no cause except&mdash;oh, I burn with shame when I
think of it. The Duke believes that he cares for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; she asked all innocently, mistaking
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle, quickly.
&#8220;I mean the Duke himself; he&mdash;he forced the words on
me after I saw you to-day. Oh, it is shameful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle, it is a terrible charge you are bringing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth; and in such a pass as this, nothing
less than the truth will serve. If it is terrible merely to
speak of, what is it actually to do it? Gerard&#8217;s life is in
danger because he loves me and I love him. That is the
infamy of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some moments her friend made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot believe it, Gabrielle,&#8221; she said at length, in
a voice of such pain that Gabrielle turned and threw herself
at her side and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dearest friend, oh, forgive me. I did
not think what I was saying. In my mad selfish sorrow
I forgot the suffering I was causing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This then was the reason why he urged me to-day. I
understand now. It comes as the last of many wrongs,
the crown of so many sorrows;&#8221; and a deep and bitter
sigh escaped her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dearest and truest, forgive me,&#8221; whispered
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not you need seek forgiveness, Gabrielle&mdash;and
he need never ask it. He hid this from me, pleading
every other ground&mdash;policy, expediency, the good of the
people, the needs of Morvaix&mdash;anything and everything
but this. Ah, Gabrielle, the bitterest hour of a woman&#8217;s
life is when she wakens to the knowledge that her worst
enemy is her own husband.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;My dearest, my dearest,&#8221; murmured Gabrielle. &#8220;I
am so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Gabrielle, we will not grieve, we will act. Together
we will plan and save your lover, be he true man
or false: for false a man may always be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Gerard. Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s mercy we will hope not, for your sweet
sake. For though he be true as steel, yet is he in a sorry
plight; and we, you and I together, sweetheart, will save
him. We must first get him out of the Castle and the
task may test our wits. Think, child, think; don&#8217;t waste
time in useless repinings over the inevitable. We have
work to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew I could rely on you,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;First we must find out where they have bestowed him.
Pauline can do this. She is old Pierre&#8217;s daughter&mdash;you
know how together we saved her from ruin&mdash;and she
will serve us both to the death; and so too will her
father. Call her, and she will be at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle hastened away to return in a minute with
the maid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pauline, we are going to trust you,&#8221; said the Duchess.
&#8220;You will be faithful, I know; and will do what we need
cleverly and secretly&mdash;for Mademoiselle de Malincourt&#8217;s
sake as well as mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart, miladi,&#8221; answered the girl, a
bright-eyed shrewd brunette.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been an arrest in the Castle, within the
past hour or so, of a M. de Cobalt. Go and find out
where he has been bestowed. Your father can tell you.
No one else must know that I have even asked. And
be quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me hope already,&#8221; said Gabrielle, as the
girl left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do more than that; child, I will give you your
lover. I am feeble and bed-ridden, but not yet helpless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
As soon as we know where he is, we will have a plan to
set him free. I know the secrets of every cell in the
Castle; and unless he has been placed in one of the underground
dungeons of the keep, there is not one I cannot
help him out of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their impatience and anxiety made the interval before
Pauline&#8217;s return seem long; but when she came, she had
done her errand well and brought the expected news.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman is placed in one of the cells in my
father&#8217;s ward, miladi,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and very strict orders
have been given as to his close watching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which cell, Pauline?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s eyes signalled
trouble at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, miladi,&#8221; she exclaimed, distressfully. &#8220;He was
at first placed elsewhere and has just been moved by the
Governor&#8217;s orders into the&mdash;the turret cell.&#8221; She shuddered
as she mentioned it and glanced toward Gabrielle
who noticed the look and the gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the turret cell?&#8221; she asked. Pauline bit her
lips and was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;A place from which he must be rescued, Gabrielle, as
soon as we can form the plan;&#8221; and the Duchess warned
Pauline with a glance to be silent. &#8220;While the daylight
lasts nothing is possible; but as soon as darkness falls the
attempt must be made. Pauline, you must go to your
father again, and tell him from me that no harm must
befall this prisoner, and that at the least sign of danger,
notice must be brought to me. The escape must be
managed to-night; and say that later I will send full instructions
how he is to act. If he can offer a suggestion,
let him send it by you. I will protect him from the
Duke&#8217;s anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father would give his life for you, miladi,&#8221; said
Pauline earnestly, and hurried from the room again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, Gabrielle, your lover shall be free to-night.
We can get him from the cell where he lies; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
it is more difficult to get him from the Castle. Yet
where can he remain until the chance offers? Come,
child, let us set our woman&#8217;s wits to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this turret cell that both you and Pauline
were afraid even to mention to me? I saw the looks that
passed between you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess paused for a moment and thought
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had best know, perhaps, Gabrielle, for you may
have to use the secrets of the place. It is the place which
you may have heard called the &#8216;Tiger&#8217;s Den.&#8217; A place
of devilish contrivances where prisoners are put to the
question and where many dark deeds have been done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean they would dare to torture him?&#8221; cried
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you merely that you may know the urgency of
the matter. But diabolical as the place is, it may yet
serve our purpose better than another. It stands high
up in the north turret, and its one barred window overlooks
the courtyard, sixty feet below. Death waits for
the unhappy prisoner who thus seeks escape; and many
a man has gone that way to his death. But with a stout
rope, a clever climber can reach the bottom safely; yes,
yes, I have the idea,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Let me think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me. I am on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One devilment of the place is this. A part of the
wall with the portion of the floor next to it is false. On
this the prisoner&#8217;s pallet is laid; and when the wretched
man is asleep the floor and the wall together can be
turned outward with sudden swiftness by the hidden
mechanism, and the sleeper is shot out and down to his
death on the stones below. The wall is then replaced
and by another hidden trick the bars of the windows are
made to appear as if wrenched from their places, and
thus the suggestive evidence is ready to show that the
prisoner has killed himself in an attempt to escape.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Can such things be possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no limit to man&#8217;s cruelty to man, child; we
can use this window trick for our end. I can tell you
how to find the spring that moves the bars; you can take
to your prisoner such a rope as would enable him to
escape, open the bars, leave the rope dangling from the
casement to suggest he has so fled; and then bring him
here, where he can lie hid until we can find means to
smuggle him out of the Castle and Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God it were dark already,&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle
eagerly. &#8220;Till the time comes, the seconds will be
as hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment they were interrupted and news was
brought that Lucette was asking for Gabrielle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>PASCAL AND THE SPY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LUCETTE&#8217;S visit to the Castle in quest of Gabrielle
was the result of several causes which had important
bearing upon the position.</p>

<p>In the first place Gerard&#8217;s plan to send a second messenger
in hot haste to Cambrai, urging his cousin in
command of the Bourbon troops there to hurry on to
Morvaix, had been delayed. The messenger had been
stopped at the city gate.</p>

<p>Pascal, in his monk&#8217;s garb, was present and had been
greatly disconcerted and not a little alarmed by the mischance.
If it meant nothing more serious it must involve
delay. The message must be despatched somehow,
that was certain, because everything depended upon the
troops being brought up at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>To attempt this in the daylight seemed impracticable;
since the messenger would have to drop from the walls
at some favouring point, and the cover of darkness was
necessary for such a venture. Moreover, a spot would
have to be found where the thing could be done; and
neither Pascal nor any of his men knew enough of the city
to select one. There was, further, the imminent risk that
the courier, being on foot, might be intercepted and so
the whole plan fail.</p>

<p>But in this dilemma, help came most unexpectedly. A
stranger accosted Pascal, and recognizing him as the
monk who had stood between the citizens and the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in the market place, offered his assistance. He was, he
said, the brother of Babillon the smith, the murdered man.</p>

<p>After a few pointed questions Pascal decided to accept
his help, and left him in the care of his men, while he
made fresh plans. He resolved that two couriers should
go to Cambrai by separate paths, each carrying a
despatch; and in view of the grave risks he decided to
be one of them.</p>

<p>He returned accordingly to Malincourt, in his character
of servant, to find Gerard and get the despatch
duplicated; but on learning that Gerard was still at the
Castle, he assumed once more his monk&#8217;s garb and went
after him.</p>

<p>The news that met him greatly increased his uneasiness.
Both Gerard and Dubois had been arrested by
the Duke, for what reason no one knew for certain, although
it was rumoured that his assumed character had
been discovered. Pascal knew enough to guess more, and
he was not long in deciding how to act.</p>

<p>It was clear that with both Gerard and Dubois in confinement
he himself could not leave the city and could
not get a second despatch from Gerard; and, further, that
without waiting for the cover of darkness a courier must
be got out of the city at once.</p>

<p>He could act very promptly at need, and he did so
now. He added a letter to the leader at Cambrai telling
him what had befallen Gerard and urging the utmost
haste; and wrote two other despatches for d&#8217;Alembert
describing the situation. By the aid of Babillon two
men were despatched at once from different points with
orders to procure horses at the earliest moment after
getting free of the city and to ride with all speed to
Cambrai; and he impressed upon both that the life of
their young lord might depend upon their zeal. The third
despatch two carefully picked men were to carry, and
were not to start until dark had fallen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The next problem was the much more difficult one of
getting Gerard out of the Governor&#8217;s hands. This must
be done by force if necessary and in the last resort; and
a place must be provided to which he could be brought,
where a stand could be made with some hope of holding
the Governor at bay until d&#8217;Alembert could reach the
city with the troops.</p>

<p>Malincourt was obviously the best place for such a
stand. It was strongly built, had ample room for the
necessary force of men, and was sure to contain a store
of provisions which could be increased without any suspicion
being raised. Moreover, he believed there were
arms there.</p>

<p>He instructed the men in the city, therefore, to go in
their monk&#8217;s gabardines and purchase each for himself
enough provision for three days, on the plea that they
were setting out on a pilgrimage on the morrow; after
which they were to remain in readiness for a summons
to meet him at any hour.</p>

<p>Having the first steps arranged, he returned to Malincourt,
omitting in his haste to put off his monk&#8217;s gown.
He meant to see Gabrielle and tell her plainly what his
plans were, and consult with her as to the best means
of rescuing Gerard and Dubois.</p>

<p>Here came a check, however. Gabrielle was not at the
maison; and as he stood in the great hall considering how
he could best find her, he was seen by Jacques Dauban.
The spy had been sent back to Malincourt by de Proballe
to fetch away certain papers which now that the maison
was shut to him, were too incriminating to be left there.</p>

<p>It was Dauban who had carried the news to the Governor&#8217;s
Castle that Gerard was not really de Cobalt, and
having been a witness of Dubois&#8217; arrest, was struck by
the fact that another monk, of the same order apparently,
should be found at Malincourt. Scenting a mystery he
resolved to follow it up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Pascal, unwilling to be recognized in his disguise,
would have avoided him, but Dauban made this impracticable,
and thus Pascal was reduced to the device of
drawing his cowl close so as to hide his features so far
as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you gooden, good father?&#8221; began Dauban.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Pax vobiscum</i>, son,&#8221; replied Pascal, deepening and
altering his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you, father? I am of the household here&mdash;the
secretary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then truly you may. I have a message I would deliver
to miladi of Malincourt, and would have speech
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know her business well and am high in her confidence.
Is it a matter of urgency? I am even now on my
way to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you get to her at once, or deliver a letter
secretly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be easy enough&mdash;the letter I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I trust you?&#8221; Dauban met the piercing eyes
fixed on him through the close drawn cowl, as if in suspicion,
and answered as he thought with cunning
frankness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be as you please. Miladi herself does.
But you must decide quickly, for she waits for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The monk appeared to hesitate and glancing round
lowered his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know aught of this business of the so-called
Gerard de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so loud, father. I know of his arrest and am
even now engaged in the task of procuring his release.&#8221;
It was a clever lie and seemed to impose on the monk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lead me where I can write. Life
and death depend on your good faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; said Dauban, and led the way to de
Proballe&#8217;s apartments. On the way they chanced to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Lucette, who looked at the pair with curious eyes. Wondering
what Dauban could be doing in such company, she
followed at a distance and resolved to watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we alone here?&#8221; asked Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite. You need have no fear on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those doors&mdash;are they locked? If not, lock them and
bring the keys here.&#8221;</p>

<p>All unsuspecting and wishing to win his companion&#8217;s
confidence, Dauban did so and laid the keys on the table
before him. As if still doubting, Pascal glanced round
the room for himself, taking advantage of the minute
to loose his habit stealthily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paper, monsieur,&#8221; he said, and while Dauban&#8217;s back
was toward him he slipped off his habit and laughed.</p>

<p>At his laugh Dauban turned, and the colour fled from
his face in the fright of the recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Master Spy, we will have a little talk and an
understanding,&#8221; said Pascal. &#8220;Sit down there,&#8221; pointing
to a seat, &#8220;and if you give but one faint sign of resistance,
I&#8217;ll first break half the bones in your body up
here, and then pitch you from the casement yonder for
the courtyard stones to break the other half.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spy sat staring open-eyed and agape at him,
cursing himself for his blindness in not having recognized
Pascal; and cudgelling his wits how to get out of the
trap into which he had walked, and in abject fear for
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought to trap me, Master Spy, and instead I&#8217;ve
trapped you. Now understand, I&#8217;m in too dangerous a
mood to bear any trifling and am in desperate haste. Do
all I tell you and do it at once, and answer my questions
plainly, and you&#8217;ll save your life; but try to fool me and&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ve told you what I&#8217;ll do, and I&#8217;m a man of my
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no desire&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, till I bid you speak. This is your master&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
room and you are in his confidence. You know the part
he has played in all this business about M. de Cobalt.
Find at once and give to me every paper that concerns it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing, monsieur, I swear; and there are
no papers. I&#8217;ll swear it on the holy crucifix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you keep me dallying in this way the next oath
you take about it will be in hell,&#8221; growled Pascal sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare on my soul&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But before he could say
more Pascal had him by the throat and shook him till his
teeth rattled and the stars came out in myriads in the
firmament of his dazed sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now perhaps you&#8217;re frightened enough to tell the
truth,&#8221; he cried, with a fierce oath, as he flung him back
on the seat. The spy fell doubled up against the table
and as Pascal jerked him up again he heard the crackle
of papers under his doublet.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have them on you, you sly devil, have you?
Strip, to the skin, and let me see what&#8217;s there. If I play
valet for you you&#8217;ll find little play in it, on my oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all, monsieur,&#8221; gasped Dauban, faintly.
&#8220;Let me but get my breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want no more of your lies. Give me the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are there,&#8221; and Dauban pointed to a desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, master liar, but first I&#8217;ll have those on
you. Quick or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and another threatening gesture
finished the sentence.</p>

<p>Slowly and with a groan of anguish, Dauban took out
some of the papers he had concealed in his clothes, and
laid them on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest,&#8221; said Pascal, putting these out of the spy&#8217;s
reach. &#8220;Strip and don&#8217;t try my temper farther, or I&#8217;ll
not answer for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trembling so that his aching teeth chattered, Dauban
obeyed the command; and as each garment was drawn
off Pascal examined it for any concealed documents, and
a quick glance at what he found showed him the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and value of his discovery. He had the proofs not only
of de Proballe&#8217;s infamy but also of the Duke&#8217;s complicity
in everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now open these places and, while I search, put on
your clothes again. Quick!&#8221; he thundered.</p>

<p>Then Dauban formed a plan. Terror-stricken though
he was, he had yet sense to reflect that he could never
face his master with such a confession. He donned his
clothes rapidly and going to the cupboard said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a secret hiding place here, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Pascal was as sharp as a dagger&#8217;s point, and on
the instant detected a change of tone, and was ready for
a trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it,&#8221; he said, curtly, and without turning his
head shifted his position just sufficiently to watch the
spy. Dauban made a pretence of opening some secret
recess and Pascal saw him snatch up something and
conceal it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is open, monsieur,&#8221; said the spy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Fright makes a ready servant of you,&#8221; replied
Pascal; and as if unsuspicious of treachery, crossed the
room turning his back to give the spy his chance.</p>

<p>With a quick stealthy rush Dauban sprang forward
only to find himself foiled, his uplifted right hand caught
in a grip of iron, the weapon taken from it and himself
pinned against the wall with fingers of steel playing on
his windpipe and Pascal&#8217;s eyes gleaming close to his. He
wriggled and fought with the strength of despair; but
the air was shut from his lungs, his sight grew blurred,
a blood red mist surged about him, and then all was dark
with the darkness of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sly treacherous devil,&#8221; murmured Pascal, as he
let the inert helpless body of the spy slip to the ground.
&#8220;Who&#8217;d have thought he&#8217;d even enough pluck for such
a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>What to do with him was a difficulty, however. Pascal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
had already lost time which could ill be spared and having
had one experience of Dauban&#8217;s cleverness in slipping
out of his bonds, he was loth to trust again to mere cords.</p>

<p>A hurried search of the room offered no solution, and
for the moment there seemed nothing for it save the
desperate step of plunging the knife into his heart. He
had earned death by his last murderous attack, and Pascal
picked up the weapon; but he shrank from the deed,
and with the object of obtaining the assistance of some of
the household, he opened the door.</p>

<p>In the corridor he found Lucette strolling near the
room with an assumed air of indifference. On seeing him
she made as if to hurry away, and he called her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, you must help me,&#8221; he said, somewhat
brusquely and with a touch of command in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the monk, monsieur?&#8221; she asked, shrinking
from him, &#8220;and Jacques Dauban? What is the meaning
of that knife?&#8221; and she pointed at the knife which
unwittingly he retained in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the monk, mademoiselle. For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t
run off in that way.&#8221; He turned and tossed the knife
back into the room. &#8220;Did you think I had murdered
myself and with an unstained knife?&#8221; he asked, and
smiled. &#8220;I am here on M. de Cobalt&#8217;s business and
miladi of Malincourt&#8217;s, and I must have help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reassured by his tone she returned then.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That which may help to straighten all this devil of a
tangle. I have tricked that spy of de Proballe&#8217;s and
pinched half the life out of him, and must have help to
get him safely caged. He proved too slippery for me
once before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you;&#8221; and he opened the door so that she
saw Dauban.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; she asked, shrinking again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;He would be if he had his deserts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does it all mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a cauldron of troubles as the devil loves to set
a-bubbling, mademoiselle. M. Gerard de Cobalt has been
found to be not Gerard de Cobalt and the Governor has
clapped him into one of his Castle cells; this cur here and
his mangy master are at the bottom of it&mdash;I have just
laid hands on the written proofs of their part. I have
had a busy afternoon and am in search of Mademoiselle
de Malincourt, and must find her at once. I have no time
to fill in the details for you; so smother your curiosity
and just say if you will help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a commanding way with you, monsieur,
for a serving man,&#8221; cried Lucette with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no serving man, but just a soldier; and by your
leave have no time for badinage. There is much to be
done, and talk must wait on action. I want irons and
a guard for this carrion here. Can they be got in the
maison? If not, I must take the knife to him, much as
I dislike it. But his babbling tongue must be silenced,
or we shall all be in peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not kill him in cold blood?&#8221; cried Lucette,
with a look of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would kill any one and any thing that stood between
me and my master&#8217;s safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get what you need,&#8221; she said, and hurried away,
to return quickly with a couple of men with manacles.
Pascal gave them his orders, and placing the gyves on
Dauban&#8217;s wrists&mdash;none too gently, for the spy was hated
by every one&mdash;they carried him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, mademoiselle, you must find a place of security
for these,&#8221; said Pascal, giving Lucette the papers. &#8220;De
Proballe may come in search of his precious spy, and he
must not find these, nor must any one know aught of the
spy&#8217;s whereabouts. If my advice be followed I would
clap the master in the next cellar to this man; but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
as you please. Now, how to find Mademoiselle de Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is still at the Governor&#8217;s Castle. You can seek
her there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, by your leave, that can I do only in the last
extreme. Suspicion is all over the place, and if they were
to clap me by Dubois&#8217; side there would be more to pay
than we can just now afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dubois? Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another of this Governor&#8217;s prisoners, and while he&#8217;s
in I must keep out. Will you go to miladi?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will. What shall I tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the liberty and perhaps the lives of the prisoners
depends upon her seeing me instantly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who shall I say you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what you like&mdash;that I am close in my master&#8217;s
confidence and have a plan for liberating him, if she will
but come to me quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this conversation which sent Lucette hurrying
in hot haste to seek Gabrielle at the Castle, while Pascal
employed the time of her absence in examining Malincourt
with an eye to putting it in the best condition of
defence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>GABRIELLE PLEADS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GABRIELLE heard Lucette&#8217;s story with intense
interest, and saw that with help from Pascal
outside it might be possible to get Gerard away
from Morvaix without concealing him first in the
Duchess&#8217;s apartments; and she resolved to go immediately
to Malincourt to consult with Pascal.</p>

<p>But she found the Duchess opposed to this.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go and then return to me, Gabrielle, it may
provoke notice and start suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must see Pascal,&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then safer to see him here. Let him come as if to
me. I have frequent messengers from friends; and his
coming will cause no talk. He can come as with a message,
say, from the Count and Countess d&#8217;Auvaine, and
no questions will be asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is known to some in the Castle. M. de Proballe,
for instance, and others; and recognition would be ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be worse, child, if a watch were set on
yourself and so the way to the prison quarters blocked.
If this gentleman is loath to risk coming here, let it be
known that you are staying with me for a few days&mdash;as
you have done before&mdash;and let Lucette carry your
messages. There is reason for her passing to and fro,
as you will need many things for your stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right; I will go and tell Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was about to leave when Pauline returned.</p>

<p>She had seen her father, she said, and he had readily
agreed to do anything that was asked of him. He advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
that the best hour for making any attempt would
be about ten o&#8217;clock at night; as the guard would be
changed at eleven, and they were always less vigilant in
their last hour of their watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father says there will be a great risk, miladi,&#8221;
said Pauline; &#8220;and urges the utmost caution. He declares
it will be far safer for all concerned if the prisoner
makes his escape by the window and avoids the hazard
of encountering any of the soldiers or servants in attempting
to leave by any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It could be done,&#8221; said Gabrielle, readily, &#8220;now that
this Pascal can help from outside. I will send him word
by Lucette of the time, and tell him to find means of
getting to the courtyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hurried to Lucette and told her the plan and the
reasons why it was not deemed prudent for her to leave
the Duchess, and they were discussing this when the
Governor entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will know what I shall need for a few days,
Lucette,&#8221; said Gabrielle, with a swift warning glance;
&#8220;and if I have forgotten anything in my haste, you can
bring it or even return for it. How is Denys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much improved, but very weak, of course, and fretting
at his weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to speak with you, mademoiselle,&#8221; interposed
the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am remaining some days with the Duchess, monsieur,
and am sending instructions in regard to matters
at Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good news; it is as I would have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing more, Lucette, and the most important
of all&mdash;M. de Proballe is not to be allowed to enter the
maison until my return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a harsh injunction, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the mistress of Malincourt, my lord, and am
firmly resolved on the point.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;I shall hope to change that resolve amongst others,&#8221;
he replied, as Lucette went away. &#8220;It is for that I wish
to speak with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle made no reply for the moment. The storm
of her indignation against the Duke had passed, as he
noticed with satisfaction; but he could not read her
present mood; and mistook a deliberate intention to outwit
him for a readiness to listen with some complacency
to the alternatives he had come to propose. The hope of
setting Gerard free spurred her woman&#8217;s wit to the
utmost. She was, indeed, ready enough to listen to him,
schooling her temper and keeping it under control, so
as to learn his plans. She was fighting the cause of the
man she loved against the man she hated with hate implacable;
and she would fight warily and coolly, with
every weapon in her armoury, and with a full knowledge
of all the danger that might follow a false step.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have spoken with your uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no longer kin of mine, my lord,&#8221; she interposed,
coldly. &#8220;He has wronged me beyond endurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, with M. de Proballe then, and have convinced
myself that he has had no motive save that of serving
your best interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As head of my house, monsieur, it is for me to say
whom I count upon my side and whom I deem against
me. Never again will I speak to or see M. de Proballe.
I hold him for my worst enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what of me?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done a bitter injustice and a cruel wrong
to an innocent and gallant gentleman&mdash;but it is in your
power to repair it. Will you speak the word that will
undo it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Innocent?&#8221; he carped. &#8220;Was it innocent to steal
among us in a false name and character. Was it gallant
to act such a lie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was forced into it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;How forced and by whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need we pretend that we do not know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he replied bluntly. &#8220;Who is he, if
he be not indeed this de Cobalt? I have clear proof that
he was spying in the Castle here. If he be not de Cobalt,
then is he a spy. Am I to suffer my Castle to be overrun
by spies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no spy; of that I am assured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if an honest man, why this mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle knew the reason, recalling with a little thrill
of delight how he had said it was for her sake; but she
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is every honest man who comes to Morvaix to be
treated as a spy and thrown like a dog into a prison cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were Governor here you would see this as
I do; but I am indeed almost persuaded that he is still
only deceiving us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he is in truth what he avowed himself at
the first&mdash;Gerard de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you yourself and M. de Proballe held it disproved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The letter may have been but a trick, like other
things. He had deceived us as to the flagrancy of that
act of his at Cambrai; and knowing it to be too vile to
be pardoned, had this further lie enacted, meaning to pass
for some one else and so save his head. But he will not
save it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean he will be tried for the crime?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean he&#8217;ll lose his head for it,&#8221; was the blunt
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not do this foul injustice,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
with a touch of indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who murders, dies, mademoiselle; that at least is
law all over France; and Morvaix is no city of shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must not die; you cannot be so cruel.&#8221; Half protest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
half entreaty was in her tone; and the Governor
paused and bent his eyes upon her before he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your sake more than any other&#8217;s, it is best that
he should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, with a
catch of the breath as in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has impressed you so deeply that, were his life
spared and his liberty given to him, you would never be
safe from him. He is a murderer, a man of the vilest
life, who would never cease to persecute you, after what
has passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an even deeper depth of vileness in this
man than she had deemed, was Gabrielle&#8217;s thought; and
for a moment it cost her a supreme effort to remain
calm. But the thought of Gerard&#8217;s peril came to her
aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you would kill him out of consideration
for me?&#8221; she asked, as if incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do anything for you&mdash;either kill or pardon,
but you will not let me,&#8221; he answered, with the first
touch of passion.</p>

<p>He had led round to his object cunningly; but not so
cunningly that she did not understand him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I <i>may</i> ask you,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Prove to me his
unworthiness first; and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot prove it, monsieur,&#8221; she cried, as though
she had first wavered in her faith and then rallied it.
And so he read her words. &#8220;He is what I have said, an
innocent and gallant gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he be Gerard de Cobalt he is a murderer of the
vilest and most treacherous type. I have the fullest
proofs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he be not M. de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he has shown himself a spy; and spies when
they are caught must take their chances. But he is more
than a spy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has deceived you with specious lies, has won
upon you until the scene below to-day showed your feelings.
You are the head of a noble house, mademoiselle,
whose influence here in Morvaix is too great to be at the
mercy of either a treacherous scoundrel or a hireling spy.
And while you remain unmarried and at his mercy, because
of your gentle trustful heart and of the feeling
he has stirred within you, such a man cannot be at
large. The interests of all in Morvaix render it impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again you make the strange suggestion that this is
done for my sake,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is true, Gabrielle. Were it not for you, the
prisoner might go free this moment.&#8221; Every word
spoken was now chosen to bring him nearer to his
object.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he be the unworthy man you say, do you hold
me for a thing too feeble and weak to withstand his evil
influence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worthy or base, it is as I say. His freedom rests
on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In plainer words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Consent to do as I have asked you, and the man&#8217;s
fate is for you to determine. As my wife, Gabrielle,
your lightest wish would be my law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I still refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was a shrug of the shoulders and a lifting
of the hands. He looked for another storm to burst;
and was surprised when Gabrielle remained quiet, cold
and thoughtful. He read the sign to be favourable to
him. Hitherto she would not even listen. He felt the
strength of the weapon he wielded, and was glad.</p>

<p>She paused as if in deep distress and fear, and sighed
as she asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think such a union as you suggest could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
bring happiness to either of us, or having such a beginning
could end in aught but ruin to all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Gabrielle; that will suffice for all,&#8221; he
declared passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spare me that, I beg of you,&#8221; she cried quickly and
very earnestly. &#8220;When you spoke of this to me before,
I answered you out of my indignation. I am cooler
now; but can you not think how such a declaration sounds
to me? It is not one jot less terrible because I school
myself to listen without temper. Can you not feel what
treachery it is to my dearest friend, your wife&mdash;surely
the purest wife ever given to a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is willing for our marriage to be dissolved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that make my treachery to her less ignoble?
If the thing stood on any other ground than where you
put it by these words, it would still be wrong&mdash;a cruel,
cowardly wrong to her; but to plead for it no more than
mere passion, is to clothe it with its vilest dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other reasons&mdash;many,&#8221; he said sullenly.
&#8220;You wish to wield influence in the rule of the people;
I give you a chance. &#8217;Twas but yesterday I put the
matter so to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The baseness of the act is not lessened by wrapping
it about with specious pleas. And I will be frank with
you; for frankness in such a crisis is best. I could
never feel to you as a wife should feel toward her husband.
The shame of this wrong to my friend would
ever be a canker to blight all other thoughts, and make
my life&mdash;our lives&mdash;one lengthened monotone of remorse
and pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would leave that issue to time and my love. You
did not think thus until within the last few hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will deal with you frankly, as I said. I understand
you; and in some part you are right. I love this
man who is in your power. I believe him good and
true and noble; I am not ashamed of my love. Love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
comes to every woman at some time in her life, and she
is powerless to resist it. That is our nature. This has
come to me. Could I then wed another man while yet
the love for him burns like a fever, filling my heart with
thoughts of him, gladdening it with hopes for him; and
forming already more, far more, than half my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are frank, as you say; but such frankness is
ill hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it be ill to hear me speak of it&mdash;and I am calm
enough to speak without temper and say this not to
anger but to prevail with you&mdash;if it be ill for you to
hear me speak of it, what would it be in the after time
to live ever with the knowledge of it? Think you that
happiness lies that way? You with the knowledge that
my heart is given to another man; I with the bitterness
of remorse for the wrong you would have me do, relieved
only by the ever aching sorrow of a broken heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to hear no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but you must hear me. Only a coward would
shut his ears to the truth; and you at least are no coward.
You have not thought what kind of thing this really is
that you would do. Were I to wed you as you now wish,
we should grow to hate one another. Your passion would
cool and you would come to feel the bitterness of the
mistake, the galling yoke of the load on your life and
would look on me as the cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You little know me, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then at least I know myself. I am but a girl and
very human; and in the long dark hours of my misery
and unavailing remorse, my spirit, unbroken&mdash;for we
Malincourts are not easily broken&mdash;would revolt against
you as the cause. Would yours be happier? Have you
thought what life would be to be mated with a woman
who hated you, as we Malincourts can hate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you. I think of naught else,&#8221; he said doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love! Love! What sort of love is that which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
blight and destroy the object that has kindled it? What
is it in me you think you love? My face? My form?
Would these retain their comeliness in your eyes when
you knew that beneath them burnt the fire of hate?
When I could never suffer you, without a shudder, even
to look into my eyes? When at your approach you found
me shrink; when your lightest touch would seem to be
repugnant? Oh, put this cowardice away from you, and
understand the truth as it is. If there be this feeling
for me that you deem, have courage to see that it is
wrong and evil. If it were love it would be selfless, and
you would seek my happiness, not your own mere desires.
The flame will burn out and die down; and if you will
but act as a man should act, you will grow to hate the
thing you now desire, and thank me for having kept
you true to a man&#8217;s better part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you would have me see you marry
this man? I would see you dead sooner. And he shall
die,&#8221; he cried fiercely. &#8220;My mind is made up. If you
will not save him, his blood will be on your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle had not hoped to move him, and his decision
stirred no surprise. She had pleaded urgently and
sweetly; but with another thought than that of prevailing
with him. She had to disarm his suspicion so that
time might be gained, and now began to let her alarm
make itself evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must not die; he must not,&#8221; she said, after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can save him by a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have time. I have told you I love him; and
I swear to you that if he were to die now I could not&mdash;nay,
I would not survive him. I would take my own
life. My God! I could not bear it yet,&#8221; she cried, wildly
and vehemently.</p>

<p>He had not looked for this; and the thought, impressed
as it was by the conviction that she was in deadly earnest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
alarmed him and kept him silent. Before he could find
any words to reply, she continued with equal vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, it shall be so. You are right, you are right.
His blood will be on my head. I shall be his murderess.
His murderess!&#8221; She changed her almost hysterical
passion to a low tone of intense earnestness as she
repeated the words. &#8220;His murderess! Then it is right
that I should die. Who kills, dies. It is the law of the
universe. And how I should welcome death! Do this
thing. Kill him; kill him. Do not stay to give me time
to learn that he is unworthy; and let me die, loving him,
trusting him, and believing him to be the noblest and
best man in all fair France. Then indeed can I die happy
and be happy to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The outburst prompted just the thought she designed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I prove him first to be the scoundrel that he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot. That you cannot do. Oh, I can bear
no more,&#8221; she cried in a voice vibrating with pain and
distress. &#8220;He is in your power to do with as you please.
Do what you will and so let me free. If he be the man
I believe, he will welcome death before my dishonour;
and if he be not, at least you can spare me the pain of
knowing it. You will not be merciful in one way, then,
for the sake of God, be merciless in all. The sooner
the end, the more welcome death in such a case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must think of this,&#8221; he said sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; Eyes and face and manner
all full of fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know this man for the scoundrel he is.
You must not cast your life away for a worthless villain.
I will have the truth made plain to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now I see how you hate him,&#8221; she cried distractedly.
&#8220;You would blacken his name even in my
memory. How hard and harsh a man you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is right you should know the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not seek to know it. Spare me. I cannot bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the suspense. My very courage to die may be killed by
delay; already I can feel it waning. A week of suspense
and I should be coward enough even to wish to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know the truth. I will find it out; and
when his rank unworthiness is proved to you, you will
see the folly and madness of this last wild resolve. You
will live to thank me yet, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why did I speak it, fool and coward that I am!&#8221;
she cried, despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well you did,&#8221; he answered; and with this he
left her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>IN THE &#8220;TIGER&#8217;S DEN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE all these plans were being hurried forward
for his release, Gerard took his imprisonment
very philosophically. There was but
one circumstance which caused him uneasiness&mdash;the
doubt whether Dubois could have had time before he was
placed under arrest to pass on the instructions he had
given him.</p>

<p>But he had no serious fear. If Dubois had been able
to set things in motion there would soon be some effort
on foot to secure his liberty; while if not, the worst
could only be that he himself would be driven to announce
his real rank to the Governor.</p>

<p>He was indeed more than half disposed to regret having
maintained silence at the moment of arrest. He had
measured the lengths to which the Governor was prepared
to go; and the brutal command to cut him down
if he resisted was one not to be forgotten. That and
the indignity to which he, Bourbon&#8217;s son, had been subjected
by this tyrant should be paid for heavily.</p>

<p>He had a recompense, however. Gabrielle had answered
nobly to the test he had made. She loved him.
He was sure of her now; and with that as a consolation
to sustain him, the hours of his retirement passed lightly.</p>

<p>When his gaolers entered and led him from the cell
in which he had first been placed to one in which stood
the instruments of torture, he regretted no longer that
he had not avowed his identity.</p>

<p>Rumours of the Governor&#8217;s savage treatment of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
prisoners had reached him, garnished with many a horrible
story of torture and violence. He had now the
evidence of this before his own eyes; perhaps to be
threatened even against himself; and these things he
might never have been able to prove had he declared himself
earlier.</p>

<p>That they were there to intimidate him he was soon
to know, for a warder entered and began to make them
ready for use.</p>

<p>Gerard watched him curiously from the spot where
he sat bound, and at length broke silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ply a strange trade, my friend,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners must be silent,&#8221; answered the man. It was
Pauline&#8217;s father, Pierre, who had received orders from
de Proballe in the Duke&#8217;s name to have the ghastly instruments
in readiness, and to do the work before the prisoner&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, too, eh? Is this another of your Governor&#8217;s
pleasant methods of hospitality?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you to be silent,&#8221; replied Pierre gruffly. He
had been both troubled and alarmed at the command
which his daughter had brought from the Duchess. Fully
prepared to do her bidding, he was nevertheless anxious
so to do it as to prevent suspicion falling on himself. To
him the event might mean life or death; and however
strong the Duchess&#8217;s intentions might be to shield him in
the event of discovery, she might lack the power, should
the Governor get proof of his treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are the Governor&#8217;s torturer,&#8221; said Gerard
next. &#8220;I don&#8217;t envy you your trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man must live,&#8221; returned Pierre.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretext for villainy and cruelty as long as the
world has been a world, I suppose. Yet were I a lusty
fellow like you, I&#8217;d find some honester use for my muscles
than to maim my fellow-men and drag their joints
asunder, Master Torturer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;I am no torturer,&#8221; said Pierre. &#8220;I am the warder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warder only, eh? You get the torture ready and
stand aside for some one with a tougher stomach to do
the mangling. Yet by the look of your face, I think I&#8217;m
wronging you. Those eyes of yours have a light in them
that speaks of a better nature than your words imply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to obey my orders. You are a soldier they
say, and should know that. Why are you placed here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question I could better put to you. To
watch you set those instruments running smoothly for
my poor bones, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a sight many a brave man has quailed at seeing.
But I mean, what is your crime; what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As much as many of the Governor&#8217;s prisoners probably;
that is, nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then these are to find the offence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a pleasant wit, warder. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierre Delmont.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you think, Pierre, that I am to be put in the
embrace of some one of those pretty toys of yours in
order to induce me to confess to something I haven&#8217;t
done? And I suppose you speak after some experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have counselled many a man to confess to some
light crime rather than face these; and more than one
has scoffed at my words to his after sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are here to frighten me with thoughts of
the torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brave man, I am told; yet many a man
brave enough on the field of battle has made his first
acquaintance with fear in this cell. God forgive the
cruelty of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in no danger, Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet not for any reasons you know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely that sentence has a double sound.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Pierre left his work, crossed toward Gerard, and
answered in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means what I did not purpose to tell you yet&mdash;that
I am your friend at the bidding of others. We
shall set you free, you and the other prisoner, the monk.
My work here I must do; otherwise I might be suspected;
and I meant to hold my tongue until it profited
to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are those others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one is coming. Silence,&#8221; said Pierre hastily, as
he withdrew to the other end of the cell and busied himself
again with his gruesome task.</p>

<p>Presently a knock sounded on the door, and Pierre
let drop the irons he held with a clanking sound. The
knock was repeated; and he opened the door.</p>

<p>The Governor and de Proballe entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you keep me waiting?&#8221; demanded the former
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was working yonder, my lord, and did not hear
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard the clanking of irons,&#8221; said de Proballe.
&#8220;I ordered him to have all in readiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre went back to his work, and the two stood looking
down at Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see now what comes of defying the Governor
and playing me false, M. Gerard de Cobalt,&#8221; said
de Proballe, with an evil smile. &#8220;And this is only the
beginning; unless you are in another mood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worthy of the Baron de Proballe to gloat over
a helpless man,&#8221; answered Gerard contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, helpless is just the right word, prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke of Rochelle has surely some other motive
in coming here than to allow this carrion to insult me,&#8221;
said Gerard, turning to the Governor.</p>

<p>The Governor smiled at de Proballe&#8217;s start of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to you with a merciful object.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;I seek no mercy at your hands, monsieur. If you
have come to do tardy justice it will suffice for me, for
you will order the gaoler there to unbind my hands and
set me free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, prisoner, not so fast,&#8221; cried de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I addressed you, monsieur,&#8221; said Gerard to the
Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would it be but mercy that should impel me to
pardon the murderer, Gerard de Cobalt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no murderer, neither am I M. de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit that you are he and no harm shall come to
you. I will keep my word and pardon you for the affair
at Cambrai.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard paused. The turn in things surprised him; and
he could not see the motive of it. The Governor mistook
his silence for hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write the admission that you are Gerard de Cobalt
and guilty of that crime, and on my oath you shall go
from Morvaix a free man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for you to question. But I gave my word
before you came and I will keep it even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I confess to a crime I never committed
and blacken&mdash;ah, I think I see. You would show the
confession to Mademoiselle de Malincourt. Is that the
motive for this unexpected mercy, as you term it? I
might have guessed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would sooner cut my hand off than write the lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well that I told Pierre to be prepared,&#8221; said
de Proballe. &#8220;We know that you are Gerard de Cobalt,
and that you devised the scheme of that letter to make
us doubt you when you saw the danger in which you
stood. But we have means at hand that will make you
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, then, do you say you are?&#8221; asked the Governor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;For what crime am I made a prisoner and threatened
with the torture?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners are to answer, not question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it your custom here in Morvaix to imprison men
first and ascertain their crimes afterwards? And to use
the rack and the boot to drive them to make a false confession?
This is not the law of France, my lord Duke,
and you will beware how you threaten me with such
iniquity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you speak and say who you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bear a name, my lord, which, were I to mention
it, would make even you pause in the contemplation of
this outrage. It is enough that I say I am a soldier and
a man of honour and standing, with full right to be in
your city. If I withhold my name now, it is only that
I may see how far report has belied the evil reputation
of your rule, and to what lengths you will go in wronging
an innocent man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave words, brave words,&#8221; sneered de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for you, monsieur,&#8221; said Gerard, turning upon
him. &#8220;Your notorious life in Paris prepared me to
find you playing the part I see you filling in Morvaix.
Having wormed your way with lies into your niece&#8217;s confidence,
you were ready to betray her in the vile scheme
your own lips confessed to me. Coward, bully, cheat, liar,
and scoundrel, the part of procurer was still open to you
in baseness; and you filled it with a treachery worthy
even of you. Have no fear: you shall have your reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fore God, this is too much,&#8221; cried de Proballe, rushing
forward to strike Gerard in the face. But the Governor
prevented him; he was none too sorry to hear de
Proballe abused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, monsieur,&#8221; he said with cold contempt. &#8220;You
take the truth badly. If you are minded to strike that
blow, I will have the prisoner set free for your benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not deserved this at your hands, my lord,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
said de Proballe; but the Governor let the protest pass
with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name, prisoner?&#8221; he said, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall hear it, my lord, never fear; and hearing
it, shall understand all that this means to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hold you for the man you have already declared
yourself. As Gerard de Cobalt you came here; you yourself
gave that name, and in it you won your way into
Malincourt; and as Gerard de Cobalt I will treat you.
I give you two hours to decide whether you will admit
this to be the truth, or compel me to have it dragged
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, my lord Duke,&#8221; cried Gerard sternly, as he
was turning to the door; &#8220;let me have this in plainer
terms. If I do not admit that I am Gerard de Cobalt, you
propose to put me to the torture to drag such a confession
from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have the truth one way or the other. Use the
time of grace well and be thankful that I concede it;&#8221;
said the Governor with a heavy threatening frown, and
motioned to Pierre to open the cell door.</p>

<p>&#8220;As there is a God, I had not believed that any man,
even you, could be capable of such infamy,&#8221; exclaimed
Gerard, as the two went out. The Governor whispered
a word or two of instruction to Pierre who came back
and resumed his work, making much noise over it.</p>

<p>Presently he crossed to Gerard, holding a set of heavy
irons which he clanked loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In his present mood he is a fiend, monsieur. He
ordered me to seek to break your nerve with the full view
of these things, and then to leave you in solitude that
your fears should gather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clank them as much as you will, I heed them not.
My nerves are tough enough to withstand a greater strain
than that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;He would keep his word, monsieur. In this mood
he is iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in truth an honest man? The breed seems
rare in the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so&mdash;as men go, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you heard what passed?&mdash;my last question and
his reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not this Gerard de Cobalt, and he knows it;
yet you heard him declare that if I would not confess
to this lie he would torture me until I did confess. If
all else slips from your memory, at least remember that;
for the time may come when I may need your testimony.
Now do what you will; I am tired and would sleep;&#8221;
and Gerard lay back on the pallet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not there where you lie, monsieur, safer here;&#8221; and
to Gerard&#8217;s surprise Pierre made him shift his position.</p>

<p>Presently Pierre left the cell, and Gerard fell asleep,
to be wakened by a sound at the door. He sat up thinking
the two hours had passed and that the Governor had
returned; then started with an exclamation of delight
and surprise, as he saw Gabrielle enter, dressed in a loose
black cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle! You!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to set you free,&#8221; she said, pausing with
blanched cheeks as her eyes ran round the cell. &#8220;What
a fearful place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have run this risk for me!&#8221; and he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I run no risk; but if risk there were, you must be
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go, mademoiselle? The door must be
locked,&#8221; said Pierre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, go, good Pierre. Keep watch and warn us of
any danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a full half-hour and more, mademoiselle.
But I will watch;&#8221; and he went out and locked the door
behind him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;How you trust me, Gabrielle,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not speak save in whispers; and there is
much to do and to tell you.&#8221; As she spoke she slipped
off the cloak and disclosed a somewhat bulky roll fastened
cunningly about her. Then she took a knife from a
sheath, and with it cut the bonds which bound Gerard&#8217;s
arms and legs.</p>

<p>He tried to rise, but fell back helpless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill!&#8221; she cried in quick alarm; and glancing
at the torture implements, which showed gaunt and gruesome
in the slanting rays of the moonlight, she caught
her breath and added&mdash;&#8220;They have not dared&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. It is but the rush of blood through my
numbed veins. It will pass in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed in relief and then cut loose the roll.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ladder of fine silk rope that will reach to the
courtyard below,&#8221; she exclaimed, as she laid it on the
pallet, while Gerard was chafing his arms and legs. He
glanced at the window bars. &#8220;They can be moved,&#8221;
she added, catching the look; and gave him rapidly a
description of the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another devil&#8217;s trick, indeed,&#8221; he muttered, with a
frown; and watched her while she sought for the spring
to release the bars. Before she found it he had regained
the use of legs and arms, and went to her help.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; she said at length, and pressed upon it
with all her strength while he tugged at the bars. Success
soon crowned their efforts, and then a place was
found where the grappling hooks of the ladder could be
fastened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the way is clear,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. There is a guard below. But we have done
our part so far. Your friend, whom you call Pascal,
will be here soon&mdash;should be here now indeed, to surprise
the man and clear the path for you below. He will come
in by the breach made for the repair of the walls, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
has friends posted there. Look if you can see anything
of him. Cautiously, or the moonlight on your face may
betray you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard peeped from the casement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no sign of Pascal. There is a guard below;
he is leaning on his musket just underneath this spot.
Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Listening almost breathlessly, the sounds from below
came up. They heard the soldier stamping his feet as
if chilled with the night air; then his musket was
grounded; and a moment later the stillness was broken
as he began to sing in a sweet tenor voice the ballad
which Lucette was fond of carolling&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;There was a maiden in Arcady</div>
<div class="verse">Whose lover both feal and true,</div>
<div class="verse">Came riding forth from the sullen north</div>
<div class="verse">Her sweet white hand to woo.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the simple words were borne to their ears they
both smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apt words,&#8221; whispered Gerard gently, as he captured
Gabrielle&#8217;s hand and carried it to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall I thank you, Gabrielle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not yet free, monsieur,&#8221; she answered, withdrawing
her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Was it not you who
once reproved me for calling you mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I think of you as Gerard, yet do I not know how
to call you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Gerard, in truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad,&#8221; and she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And sigh for gladness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sigh partly for gladness&mdash;that is a woman&#8217;s way,
Gerard; yet not all for gladness, but partly in fear lest
even now this plan of ours should in some way miscarry.
Your Pascal lingers, and yet I urged him so.
Pray look again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;He will come surely. Never yet has he failed me.
But if he were prevented, it would be no grave matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No grave matter?&#8221; she repeated anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have learnt all and more than all I came to learn,
and there is no longer need for concealment. Parlous
as my plight seems, yet I am not in such peril as you
deem, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand. What came you to learn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not ask me who I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me in your own time, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a trusting heart is yours, Gabrielle! What
proof you have given me of your love! Yet I know how
I must have tried you. Have you not even guessed why
I came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried, but failed hopelessly,&#8221; she said with a
smile. &#8220;For me it is enough that you did come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent certain messages to the Duke of Bourbon.
Have you not wondered that no answer came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you from great Bourbon? And this Pascal?
And the monk who is a prisoner? And the others of
whom Pascal spoke? You are to go to Malincourt,
where he has gathered a force of men&mdash;monks they were,
Lucette told me. Is this all a part of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We came to gather for ourselves
the truth as to this Tiger&#8217;s doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are the leader, then. Oh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused
and looked in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Bourbon&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this she fell back from him in great concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, Gerard to you, Gabrielle, my dearest; always
Gerard to you, as you will always be Gabrielle to me.
My Gabrielle;&#8221; and he stretched out his arms and folded
them about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am frightened, my lord,&#8221; she cried, burying her
face on his shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;My lord cannot hear that, Gabrielle,&#8221; he whispered
tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard,&#8221; she murmured, and lifted her face and
gazed upon him with eyes of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus then I break my pledge. I said I would not
seek a betrothal kiss till I came for it having freed
Morvaix from the claws of its Tiger; but&mdash;&#8221; and stooping
he kissed her on the lips. &#8220;My Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gerard, my knight, my love,&#8221; she whispered,
and of herself with love&#8217;s sweet rapturous abandonment
sought his lips in return.</p>

<p>They stood thus in silent happiness too deep for words,
when the stillness without was broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; It was the voice of the guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal has come,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we shall have to part. I could almost grudge
his coming. But look down, Gerard, and see what
passes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several soldiers,&#8221; he reported, his head at
the casement. &#8220;Ah, it is a ruse. Good Pascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of a moment&#8217;s struggle came up; a weapon
fell with a clang upon the courtyard stones; the press
of heavy footsteps; and then again silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done without bloodshed,&#8221; said Gerard; &#8220;and well
done, Pascal. He sees me and motions. Give me the
rope, dearest;&#8221; and he flung it out far into the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, Gerard, go,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Gabrielle? Where do you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the Duchess. She has planned this and is
our staunch friend. To-morrow I shall return to
Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you went with me. You would be
safe at Malincourt. This rope would bear us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be safe with my friend. Go, Gerard, for the
love of God, go. Every moment is precious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like to leave you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;No harm can touch me with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But first I must know that you are safely out from
this cell. Call Pierre. I cannot leave you here. The
rack would be a gentler punishment than the suspense
till I knew you were safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God keep you, dearest, till we meet at Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw his arms round her and they kissed again;
and then both started back in alarm.</p>

<p>Some one tried the door of the cell, and a voice harsh
and stern called loudly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierre, Pierre, come here at once and open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God have mercy upon us both, it is the Duke&#8217;s
voice,&#8221; whispered Gabrielle, clinging to Gerard. Then
with intense agitation in her voice she added&mdash;&#8220;Fly,
Gerard, if you love me; fly, or it will be too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, it is too late. I cannot leave you now,&#8221; he
answered, in a tone of calm strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That also were useless. He would be in before ever
we could reach the courtyard; and he would either cut
the rope and we should go to our death, or summon his
soldiers and we should be caught. I will await him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor&#8217;s voice was heard again then, oathing
and cursing at Pierre&#8217;s delay and calling to him in
strident tones to hasten.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>A LIFE AND DEATH STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was indeed a desperate situation in which Gerard
and Gabrielle found themselves, and for a few
moments Gabrielle could do no more than cling to
her lover and stare at the door, overcome by terror.
Then, shaking off her lethargy, she once more begged
him in an impassioned whisper to fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not ask it, Gabrielle; nor will he dare to
harm either of us when I tell him I am Bourbon&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will; he will, I know him and you do not,&#8221; she
urged strenuously. &#8220;Within the last few hours he
swore to have your life, if I would not consent to marry
him. If he finds us together he will have you slain
before my eyes. For the love of God, fly while there
is yet time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you risk it with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, anything; anything rather than that he
find you here,&#8221; she answered desperately.</p>

<p>At this moment they heard the key fitted into the lock
and Pierre&#8217;s voice as he replied to the Governor&#8217;s reproaches.
But before the key could be turned, Gerard
dragged the pallet to the door and wedging it against
an angle of the wall, improvised a barrier which jammed
the door fast.</p>

<p>The key was turned and those outside strained to
thrust the door back; and Pierre&#8217;s deep voice was heard
declaring that the lock was wedged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Come, Gabrielle, quick.&#8221; Gerard drew her to the
window and, getting out, stood upon the ladder and
held his arms waiting in a fever of impatience for her
to follow. She went to the window and looked out, but
with a gasp of fear shrank back, appalled by the far
descent, and shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven help me, Gerard, I dare not,&#8221; she cried. Her
nerve failed at the look of yawning darkness, and when
at the same moment a great knocking sounded against
the cell door, she fell on her knees on the floor and
buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Gabrielle, courage,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;Trust
yourself to me and all will be well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot, I cannot, I dare not. I cannot die that way.
I am a coward, Gerard. But do you go! Oh go, if
you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will not,&#8221; he answered and climbed back into
the cell, to the dismay of Pascal and his companions who
were watching below.</p>

<p>Then the clamour at the door ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean, Pierre?&#8221; asked the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lock has jammed, my lord,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I
have known it so once or twice before and reported it.
With your lordship&#8217;s leave I can get another key that
may open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick then, man, quick. And have up some men
with bars to break the lock in lest you fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His entrance will be your sentence of death, Gerard,&#8221;
whispered Gabrielle. &#8220;When roused he is too recklessly
desperate in his fury to let aught stand in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not dare to harm me, Gabrielle,&#8221; he answered
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he finds that I have come to rescue you, he
will kill you. He would do it were it the King of France
himself who stood in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard the Governor muttering to himself as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
fumbled at the lock impatiently while awaiting Pierre&#8217;s
return; and then a plan leapt into Gerard&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Quick, Gabrielle! Rouse
yourself, my dearest. I have a plan that will yet save
us both. Where is the knife you brought? He shall
come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do, Gerard?&#8221; she whispered, in a
voice of awe, rising and peering into his face in the
dim light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not murder; but I have a plan. Stand over there in
the shadow and be ready with the knife when I call to
you. Give me your cloak. Quick, now, for the love of
God. Seconds are priceless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle slipped off the cloak and handed it to him,
and stood back where he had directed.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I have moved the pallet stand as still as death,
till I call to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Making as little noise as possible he wrenched the
pallet from the door and placed it ready for use again,
and holding the cloak in readiness took his stand behind
the door.</p>

<p>As he did so he heard Pierre in the distance.</p>

<p>The Governor tried the door again then and, finding
it yield, pushed it open and entered the cell, all unsuspicious
of any danger.</p>

<p>In a moment Gerard threw a cloak over his head and,
smothering his cry of alarm in the folds of the cloak,
dashed him violently to the ground. Then leaving his
prisoner for a moment he thrust the bed once more
against the door just in time to prevent those outside
from entering, or indeed seeing what had occurred.</p>

<p>The Governor finding himself free, however, began
to shout for help, when Gerard sprang upon him again,
gripped him by the throat, and clapped a hand roughly
over his mouth.</p>

<p>The Governor was a powerful man, and he fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
with frantic efforts to free himself from Gerard&#8217;s grip.
A desperate struggle in the darkness followed&mdash;Gerard
bent on preventing a single cry from escaping his adversary&#8217;s
lips, and the Duke writhing and straining to cast
off the sinewy hands which clutched his throat and
mouth, threatening to suffocate him.</p>

<p>The silence, broken only by the hard breathing of
Gerard and the convulsive movements of the pair as they
were locked in the deadly embrace, added to the weird
terror of the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;The knife,&#8221; whispered Gerard at length, as he felt
the strength of his enemy beginning to give out; and
Gabrielle, whose courage had now returned, crept across
the cell as near to him as she dared, and held it out.
Waiting his opportunity he released the grip on his
opponent&#8217;s throat, and taking the knife held it over the
weakening man&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, my lord!&#8221; called Pierre, puzzled at not
finding the Governor at the door. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the other men whom Pierre had summoned came
up and spoke to him.</p>

<p>Tearing the cloak from the Duke&#8217;s face, Gerard let
him see the gleam of the knife in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord Duke, a single sound from your lips other
than I direct, and as I am a man, the blade goes straight
home to your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>To further the threat he pressed the dagger until the
sharp point entered the flesh; and withdrawing it, he
dragged him to his feet and held him.</p>

<p>At Gerard&#8217;s fierce tone and menacing gesture, and still
more at the slight wound inflicted, the Governor&#8217;s
courage gave, and he stood trembling in deadly fear for
his life.</p>

<p>At that moment the clamour began again at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in my power; but I do not seek your life
unless you force me by treachery,&#8221; breathed Gerard into
his ear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; The harsh strident voice was
feeble and husky as the question came from trembling
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send those men away, all of them. Say all is well,
and bid them cease their efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Realising his helplessness and too appalled by his
imminent peril to attempt treachery, he turned toward
the door and called to Pierre by name. But his quavering
voice was drowned by the din and clatter those
outside were making.</p>

<p>&#8220;Louder, louder,&#8221; whispered Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pierre, Pierre,&#8221; called the Governor; but the call
was still unheard, and with the hilt of the knife Gerard
knocked angrily at the door.</p>

<p>The clamour ceased and all was still as the grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, my lord?&#8221; asked Pierre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Pierre. Cease your efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that really you, my lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Louder, and in your natural tone, or&mdash;&#8221; threatened
Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who should it be, fellow? Send those men away, I
say,&#8221; cried the Governor with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Governor. You are to go away,&#8221; they heard
Pierre say to the others; and their footsteps were heard
as they went, growing fainter until the distance swallowed
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to go too, but to leave the keys in the door,&#8221;
prompted Gerard next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, Pierre?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you all to go away. Leave the keys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have saved your life,&#8221; said Gerard, releasing
his hold; and the Governor fell prone on the prisoner&#8217;s
bed, as Gerard gave a deep-drawn sigh of relief. The
first part of the struggle was over and had ended in
victory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>But there was yet much to do, and what course to
take was a hard problem to solve.</p>

<p>Could Gabrielle have ventured to trust herself with
him on the rope, the way would have been easy enough;
but her nerve had so failed her that he feared to ask her
again.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, therefore, but to put a bold
face on things and to find their way out together as
best they could. Leave her he would not, come what
might. After what had occurred, nothing should induce
him to let her stay within reach of the mad fiend this
Governor would be when once he was liberated from
the cell.</p>

<p>He had prevented her being seen, it was true; but the
Governor would set such inquiries on foot that her presence
in that part of the Castle would be surely discovered;
and what would follow the discovery no one could
attempt to say.</p>

<p>Yet the time was pressing with cruel insistence. Any
minute might bring de Proballe upon the scene with
the men who were to apply the torture. And under the
spur of this thought, Gerard made his plan.</p>

<p>With a threat to his prisoner to lie still on pain of
death, he gave Gabrielle her cloak with a sign to put it
on, and tearing off his coat, he whispered to her to take
it, find Pierre, get Dubois liberated, and tell him to give
her his monk&#8217;s garb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lose not a second,&#8221; he whispered earnestly. &#8220;It
may mean our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the cell door, saw her speed away on her
errand, and turned to finish his preparations.</p>

<p>Hauling in the rope ladder, lest it should be seen and
rouse suspicions, he cut the ropes, and having bound the
Governor securely hand and foot, improvised a gag with
part of the bedclothes.</p>

<p>He had just finished his task, working with desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
haste, when he heard a heavy footstep in the corridor.
Fearing it might be de Proballe, he seized the knife and
stood in readiness behind the door.</p>

<p>With intense relief he saw Pierre&#8217;s bearded face. In
silence Gerard pointed to where the Governor, thus
bound and gagged, lay in a corner of the cell, and then
donned the monk&#8217;s gabardine which Pierre had brought.
In this guise he left the cell, locking the door and taking
the key with him, and followed Pierre along the gloomy
corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are close here, monsieur, watching,&#8221; whispered
Pierre; and a moment later they came upon Dubois and
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation followed as to the least hazardous
means of getting out of the Castle. Gabrielle
was for going to the apartments of the Duchess; but
Gerard, all unwilling that she should remain a minute
longer than was necessary, would not consent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we must get you beyond this Tiger&#8217;s reach, at
any hazard. What say you, Dubois?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dubois having heard the Governor was a prisoner,
had another and much bolder scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am with mademoiselle, so far as staying here,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I would take the bold line, my lord. Keep the
Governor a prisoner; let me collect our men together,
declare yourself openly, and by a bold stroke seize the
Castle itself in the name of your father. At best we
should have half the garrison on our side; and at worst
should only have to hold this part of the Castle for some
two days. With our hundred men we could maintain it
against half an army, especially with the army disorganized
and leaderless. Mademoiselle could remain with
the Duchess in perfect safety, because the Governor
would be in our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like you, Dubois, and might succeed; but I see
a thousand difficulties.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;There are difficulties every way; but as I told you
to-day, I know the disaffection among the men here; and
the difficulties stoutly faced would yield.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard thought earnestly a moment and then shook
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hazard is too great. If we can but once reach
the courtyard, Pascal is there with a force enough to
get us through the breach in the wall I noticed to-day;
and we can then leave the city. Can you guide us by a
safe way to the courtyard, Pierre?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be done, my lord; but &#8217;tis now close on the
hour for the change of guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I decide for that,&#8221; broke in Gerard. &#8220;Lead the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is full of risks, my lord. There is an iron door
on every landing, and a sentry posted at each.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go you on ahead then; and if any difficulty is made
about our passing, leave it to us to force the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started at once&mdash;Pierre some little distance in
front, Dubois next, and Gerard with Gabrielle following.
The stairway, narrow and pitch dark, wound down the
western tower of the prison fortress; and the light from
the lantern which Pierre carried scarcely reached those
above.</p>

<p>Not a word further was spoken, and each of the three
trod as lightly as the broken uneven stairs would allow.</p>

<p>Soon they saw Pierre&#8217;s light stop and heard some one
speak to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes? Is that you, Pierre?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else, Armand?&#8221; was the gruff reply. Then a
faint chink of something falling on the stone and an exclamation
from Pierre. &#8220;Diable! I&#8217;ve dropped my key.
Lend me your eyes, Armand.&#8221;</p>

<p>A musket was set down; and a moment later the sound
of a heavy blow and a low groan, at which Gabrielle
caught her breath and shuddered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;Quick, my lord,&#8221; called Pierre; and running down
they found him bending over the unconscious form of the
sentry. &#8220;There was no other way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
would have fired his musket and roused every guard in
the Castle had he caught sight of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas cleverly done,&#8221; said Dubois. &#8220;Make sure
of him;&#8221; and he picked up the soldier&#8217;s musket, glad to
get a weapon so easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not cleverly; treacherously, monsieur,&#8221; replied
Pierre regretfully; &#8220;but there was nothing else for it;&#8221;
and he opened the iron door for them to pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to leave with us now, Pierre,&#8221; said
Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray Heaven we are as lucky at the next gate,&#8221; he
answered, and again went on ahead.</p>

<p>Fortune was with them at the next gate. The sentry
was asleep, and Pierre opened the gate and let them
through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naught but luck put the sot Crateau on guard to-night
of all nights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the Governor hears
of it his head will ache no more with liquor. There is
but one more gate, my lord, and there we may have
trouble; but once passed, a few steps only remain till
we reach the courtyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>They continued the descent as rapidly as practicable
until Pierre stopped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had better come on with me, monsieur,&#8221;
he said to Dubois; &#8220;and leave my lord and mademoiselle
to follow when we have seen the way is clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two went down together, and Gerard felt in
the darkness for Gabrielle&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not frightened, Gabrielle?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am with you,&#8221; she answered, pressing to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trembling, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for you, dearest. If we were but free of this
dreadful place!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;Courage, dear one; all will come right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God it may,&#8221; she said fervently. &#8220;What peril
I have caused you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, it is I who have brought you to this pass. But
you may trust Dubois to carry us through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you I trust, Gerard. Ah! something is happening!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre was right in anticipating trouble. As they
neared the gate they heard the voices of several men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assembling for the change of guard, monsieur,&#8221; he
whispered to Dubois. &#8220;They will let me pass, and I
shall say you are one of the new officers who joined the
Castle force recently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am one, Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought as much,&#8221; was the pithy reply. &#8220;Some of
your men may be amongst them. But I know not what
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a bold face on it and leave it to me,&#8221; said Dubois;
and the next moment they found themselves among half
a dozen men clustered by the gate. &#8220;It is a fine prison,
friend Pierre, but I don&#8217;t envy you your warding,&#8221; said
Dubois aloud, in an easy tone, as he reached the bottom.
&#8220;And these men, who are they&mdash;the guard?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the soldiers looked round, and
two of them drew themselves up instantly and saluted.
With intense satisfaction Dubois recognized them as his
own men, returned the salute, and addressed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;On guard, Vauchamp, and you, Dentelle, learning
your new duties? Good. Open the gate, Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this, Pierre?&#8221; demanded the sergeant in
command.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, don&#8217;t you know your own officers, Vauban?&#8221;
returned Pierre, in a surly tone. &#8220;Out of the way and
let me obey my orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, surly-tongue,&#8221; growled the man angrily.
&#8220;No one passes here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;Surly-tongue yourself, you uncivil beast,&#8221; returned
Pierre, and as if with sudden passion, he dealt him a
blow on the head which sent him reeling to one side, and
thrust the key in the lock.</p>

<p>Recovering his surprise and furious at the blow, the
man sprang at Pierre to be met with the butt end of
Dubois&#8217; musket full in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back, you mutinous dog,&#8221; cried Dubois, in a voice
of command, as the man fell stunned and bleeding. &#8220;Is
this the way you Castle men treat your officers? You
know better at least,&#8221; he said to his own men. &#8220;See that
there&#8217;s no more of this mutiny. Bring down the visitors,
Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no need to fetch them, for Gerard at
the first sound of trouble had hurried down with
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>The sergeant&#8217;s men, taken by surprise stood in doubt
what to do; but as two of their new comrades had
recognized Dubois for an officer and sided with him, and
being as they saw outnumbered, they offered no resistance,
and the little party were through the gate, and
the gate itself was locked before their surprise had passed.</p>

<p>The stairway now was broader and led straight to the
open doorway, which let out upon the courtyard; and
they were hurrying down, Gerard and Gabrielle leading,
when the figures of two men showed in the doorway, and
Gabrielle clutched Gerard&#8217;s arm in sudden fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;De Proballe,&#8221; she whispered, shrinking against the
wall.</p>

<p>At the same moment there came the sound of shots and
angry voices in the courtyard, and all the evidences of
a fierce battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the guard changing, my lord,&#8221; said Pierre.
&#8220;They have discovered something wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have run up against Pascal&#8217;s force,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Dubois, we must clear that doorway; or we shall be
caught like rats in a hole.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered Dubois sternly, gripping his
weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, monsieur, by your leave. I have a thought,&#8221;
urged Pierre; and without waiting to explain what it
was he ran on down the stairway to de Proballe.</p>

<small>A DASH FOR THE WALLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DUBOIS looked after Pierre with some misgivings
as he saw him accost de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he is to be trusted,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he given proof of it?&#8221; replied Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would trust him with my life,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I would trust few men of Morvaix with anything,&#8221;
returned Dubois. &#8220;I am minded to go and hear
for myself. While that din rages outside I could get up
unheard and would soon have the way clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no need for suspicion of Pierre. He
went up to de Proballe and addressed him openly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, my lord, I was seeking you. The
Governor sent me to find you for the work in the turret
cell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; asked de Proballe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I left him with the prisoner, my lord, and he ordered
me, if I should find you, to ask you to hasten to him
at once by way of the upper gallery. Jean of the Mask
has gone thither and I am in search now of the surgeon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the prisoner will be racked?&#8221; asked de Proballe,
in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rack for the one, my lord, and the weights for the
priest,&#8221; answered Pierre, so glibly and readily that de
Proballe never thought he was lying. &#8220;The Governor
is full of impatience, my lord,&#8221; he added; and de Proballe
hurried away, making an excuse to his companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;What is the trouble, captain?&#8221; asked Pierre.</p>

<p>&#8220;A quarrel with some of the new soldiers which will
end in work for you, I fancy, Pierre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems serious, captain; and I&#8217;ve work enough with
my last birds not to need more. They are to be questioned
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they, Pierre?&#8221; asked the officer eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will walk with me I&#8217;ll tell you. I am seeking
the surgeon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the officer away with this pretext, and the doorway
being thus cleared, Gerard and the others ran down
into the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way now?&#8221; asked Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find the road,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;But where is
Pierre? We cannot leave him after what he has done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we wait for him we shall have the place swarming
with men,&#8221; answered Dubois.</p>

<p>And this seemed true enough indeed. Attracted by
the news of the fighting, soldiers were beginning to pour
out of the doorways into the courtyard, laughing and
oathing as they ran in the direction of the now receding
sounds of conflict; and Gerard saw to his disquiet that
the stream was setting in the direction of that part of
the walls through which he hoped to make his escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal has had to retreat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we must
go. Pierre or no Pierre,&#8221; and giving a last glance for the
absent gaoler he set off at a brisk pace across the courtyard.</p>

<p>No one seemed to heed them and they were turning
a corner of the building when Pierre came running after
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, my lord; not a moment must be lost,&#8221; he
said, breathing hard. &#8220;I had to get rid of the captain
yonder and to find you swords. There may be some
fighting to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>They raced along for a short distance at full speed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Pierre guiding them through deserted ways until at a
turn of the walls they came in full view of the fighting,
when Pierre stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are too late,&#8221; he said hurriedly. &#8220;It would be
madness to attempt it. See, they are already close to the
breach.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was right, as Gerard recognized at a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Is there another
spot by which we can get out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know of none, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How say you, Dubois? Dare we risk it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With mademoiselle it is hopeless,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then leave me, Gerard. You can get through alone,
and I can find my way safely either to the Duchess or out
through the main gateway. No one will stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrong me in that thought, mademoiselle,&#8221; said
Dubois hastily and earnestly. &#8220;God forbid that I should
think of leaving you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would not dream of it,&#8221; declared Gerard. &#8220;We
must wait where we are until matters have quieted down,
and then go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is an old guard-house close by, my lord, where
we can wait unseen,&#8221; said Pierre. &#8220;Unused now, save
as a storehouse for the workmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the plan of the fight,&#8221; said Dubois. &#8220;It is
Pascal, right enough. See, he is drawing off his men
in good order. He knows his work when put to it,
gabble-tongue though he be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may be spied out and suspected, my lord,&#8221; said
Pierre. &#8220;Any minute may find the escape known now,&#8221;
and he told how he had got rid of de Proballe. &#8220;If the
Governor be found in your cell, hell will soon be loose in
the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Dubois, to cover,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; cried Dubois, the soldier in him rejoicing;
&#8220;they are through the walls to a man,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
reluctantly he obeyed Gerard&#8217;s injunction and followed
him to the shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can watch matters from here, monsieur,&#8221; said
Pierre, as they entered the place. &#8220;The window up
there commands a view of that part of the battlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment Dubois had clambered up, and the others
waited anxiously to hear his report.</p>

<p>&#8220;All seems well,&#8221; he said, after a minute&#8217;s observation.
&#8220;Pascal must have made off. The Castle men are not
following. They are clustered round the place like bees,
but hesitate to follow for some reason. Pascal must have
had more men posted there. That&#8217;s it. Some of the
men are straggling back. Yes&mdash;yes. Good! What&#8217;s
that?&#8221; he broke off suddenly as guns were fired from
the Castle, followed by a trumpet sounding the assembly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The escape is known,&#8221; said Pierre. &#8220;Now, Heaven
help us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are rushing back in a body,&#8221; reported
Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must take the risk and go,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go first and see the way is clear,&#8221; replied
Dubois, jumping down and darting into the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cautiously,&#8221; whispered Gerard.</p>

<p>As they left the old guard-house they saw the soldiers
running back to the Castle in hot haste to obey the call
and learn the news; and in a minute the place where
they had swarmed in such numbers was deserted except
for sentries.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must take our chance,&#8221; said Dubois, staying for
the others. &#8220;Come on with me, Pierre;&#8221; and the two
ran forward, followed at a few paces distance by Gerard
and Gabrielle.</p>

<p>The Castle itself was now the scene of great commotion.
Lights were flashing everywhere, men hurrying
in all directions, trumpets sounding, and guns booming
at intervals. Everything showed that events of deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
import had occurred and preparations on a great scale
were in progress.</p>

<p>Dubois, with Pierre at his heels, crept up the steps
and with the utmost coolness made his observations and
laid his plan. Four men were standing together close to
the breach talking eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but four men,&#8221; he whispered to Gerard;
&#8220;and we have the advantage of a surprise. We had
best attack before any more come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard nodded his assent, and dashing up the three
sprang forward and attacked the soldiers. Two of them
went down before Gerard and Dubois, and the others
broke and ran for the Castle with shouts to raise an alarm
as they sped.</p>

<p>But the way was won, and before the men could reach
their comrades to tell their news the four were safely out
and speeding away through the moonlight toward the
city.</p>

<p>The distance was short, fortunately; but short as it
was, Dubois, knowing that pursuit would soon be hot
on their heels, cast many an anxious look behind him
at the Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would to Heaven we could have met with Pascal,&#8221;
he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone to Malincourt,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should we not follow him? The pursuit will spread
out like a fan and every inch of the ground will be
scoured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could not reach Malincourt, I fear,&#8221; was Gerard&#8217;s
verdict, and then Gabrielle was ready with a suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find shelter and help in a hundred houses while
we make our plans. In the city I am sure of my people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our plans should not take long to form,&#8221; answered
Gerard. &#8220;To leave the city by the gates is impossible,
of course, and we need but a guide who will lead us to
some spot by which we can get out. Once outside we
can trust to ourselves to find the road to Cambrai.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>&#8220;To Cambrai?&#8221; asked Gabrielle. &#8220;Why to Cambrai?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because at Cambrai lies a Bourbon force strong
enough to break the Governor&#8217;s power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would we were safely housed in Malincourt to await
him,&#8221; said Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better were we safely out of Morvaix altogether,&#8221;
replied Gerard.</p>

<p>Under Gabrielle&#8217;s guidance they hurried through the
streets, in which the citizens were beginning to assemble,
attracted by the Castle guns. Groups of townsfolk stood
at the corners and in the roadways discussing the meaning
of the unusual disturbance in more or less eager
tones and with many a sign of fear lest it boded ill to
the city and themselves.</p>

<p>Now and again a soldier or two, who had been loitering
late in their revels in the city, would dash past them
scurrying Castlewards. Everywhere excitement and uneasiness
prevailed.</p>

<p>Many curious glances were cast after the four as they
hurried on their way, and once or twice, when Pierre
chanced to be recognized, a question would be flung after
him as to the meaning of the trouble at the Castle. But
no one sought to stay them, and a good distance had
been safely put between them and the Castle when
Gabrielle stopped before a long, low-gabled house in a
dark by-street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get the guide we need here,&#8221; she said. She
knocked at the door and entered, to return in a couple
of minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is bad news, I fear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You remember
the man who was slain in the market place, Babillon
the smith. This is the house of his brother; he is
entirely to be trusted. He knows every inch of the city
walls and is often passing in and out by secret ways
when the gates are shut. He says that something has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
occurred which has put the guard on the alert, and that
to-night it is scarcely possible to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me question him,&#8221; said Gerard, and they went
in together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Greeting, good friar,&#8221; said Babillon, a strong, lithe,
hard-faced, keen-eyed man, saluting Gerard respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no monk, my good fellow,&#8221; said Gerard, &#8220;but
a soldier, and together with mademoiselle here need your
help to get from the city. What is this you say has
occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A command was sent by my lord the Governor, to-day,
monsieur, that the gates were to be closed and no one
permitted to leave without a license from himself. Soon
after that I was at the south gate and having been stopped
was hanging round in curiosity, when a courier rode up
and was stopped likewise. A monk, whom I recognized,
was with him, and seeing both were much disconcerted,
I followed them and offered my services.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you describe either?&#8221; asked Gerard quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The monk was tall, erect, spare of figure, with a blue
eye sharp to read your thoughts, quick of tongue, and
customed to command, as I found afterwards. A noble,
monsieur, and yet of winning condescension and with
a laugh where many another would have a curse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be Pascal,&#8221; said Gerard to Gabrielle. &#8220;What
next, Babillon? You say you recognized him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had seen him before, my lord. It was he who
stood between you and the soldiers when my brother was
killed, mademoiselle. He told me that if I could get him
two men in secret from the city he would reward me
well; and when I showed him it could be done, he carried
me with him and left me in charge of some monks&mdash;at
least they were dressed as monks, monsieur, though my
ears being trained to catch sounds readily, I heard more
muttered oaths among them than one looks to hear from
men of holy life. I served him, monsieur, and he paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
me well; but &#8217;twas this work which has caused the city
to be shut like a bear&#8217;s cage with the door barred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got them away then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two separately while the light lasted and two together
after nightfall, but the last piece was hazardous. They
were seen, and I escaped capture by no more than a hair&#8217;s
breadth. And since then at every doubtful point where
such a thing could be attempted soldiers have been
posted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is both good and ill news you give, friend. You
have done that which will earn you a higher reward than
at present I can name. But now, can you increase my
gratitude, and get us past these guards? Think. It is
Pascal, of course,&#8221; he said to Gabrielle, while Babillon
stood thinking. &#8220;He has trebled the messengers to Cambrai.
Now, Babillon, how say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the river,&#8221; he answered, shaking his head
doubtfully. &#8220;Men might do it, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he glanced
toward Gabrielle and shook his head again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Gerard quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It runs for some three hundred yards by the walls
between the north and east gates: the walls are high
there and no one would look for an attempt at such a
spot; and so the guards are but sparsely set. I have
done it, but I have swum the stream. I can scale the
walls and could plant a rope ladder for you all&mdash;but there
is the stream,&#8221; and once more he shook his head as he
glanced toward Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go that way, Gerard,&#8221; she said instantly.
&#8220;I can lie hid if need be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not part,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Could we not get
a boat or even some planks?&#8221; he asked Babillon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be full of hazard, monsieur. With such a
watch set as there is to-night we should almost surely
be seen before we had crossed. They would fire upon
us and, even if we escaped their shots, they would send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
round a party from the eastern gate to cut us off. But
if you wish it, I am willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the disease calls for it, only a coward shrinks
from the knife,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;We must make the
attempt and leave the issue to Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had best wait here, monsieur, while I make such
preparations as I can. I may be away some time,&#8221; said
Babillon, and he hastily outlined his plan.</p>

<p>Dubois and Pierre were brought into the house and
Babillon left. Gerard explained the nature of the desperate
position to Dubois, and the three men discussed
it anxiously with many secret misgivings, while Gabrielle
went to Babillon&#8217;s wife, Gerard urging her to seek rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt we should do better to seek refuge at Malincourt,&#8221;
was Dubois&#8217; judgment. &#8220;This is a scheme for
men, and not for a dainty girl like Mademoiselle de
Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can but try it,&#8221; was Gerard&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>Babillon was absent so long that all began to grow
uneasy; but when he came he explained that he had had
much to do, and he brought less cheerless news.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been to the spot, monsieur, and found, as I
hoped, that it is scarcely watched at all. I have got help,
too. A man on whom I can rely as on myself, a fisherman,
has his boat on the other bank of the river some distance
from the spot, and he will help us. He scaled the
wall while I was by and swam the river without being
seen, and he will have his boat moored ready for us
right under the place where we shall leave. I hope now
that we shall win the way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there many soldiers abroad?&#8221; asked Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, search parties, I learnt, hunting for
some of your prisoners, friend Pierre, who have escaped
from the Castle. But they will not trouble us,&#8221; answered
Babillon. &#8220;I can lead you by ways they will never suspect.
Have no fear on that score.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Gabrielle was roused, and after some words of caution
from their guide they set out, Babillon leading them
through narrow devious streets and alleys where they met
no one.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are close to the spot now,&#8221; he said at length.
&#8220;Remain here in the shadow and I will go forward to
see that all is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was absent some few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;All seems quiet, monsieur,&#8221; he reported to Gerard,
and they started again. &#8220;The wall is yonder,&#8221; he said,
pointing to it. &#8220;I shall climb it and fix the rope in
position, and I need not urge you to make all haste in
following and to keep silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>They watched him dart across the intervening space
at top speed, stand for a moment in the deep shadow of
the wall, and then begin the ascent. Gabrielle&#8217;s heart
began to beat fast with excitement and hope, and even
the men&#8217;s pulses quickened as his black shadow crept
nearer and nearer to the parapet at the top.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he doing?&#8221; whispered Gabrielle; for
Babillon stopped suddenly and flattened himself against
the black wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; answered Gerard. &#8220;See, his head
shows above the top now. He is as cautious as he is
daring, and does but seek to make sure all is well. Wait,
he sees some one. Ah, and he has been seen, too!&#8221; he
exclaimed, catching his breath. The call of one man to
another came to their ears, and the figures of two soldiers
running toward Babillon were silhouetted against the
sky line.</p>

<p>At the same moment a jingle of arms was heard close
at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the search parties,&#8221; said Dubois in a deep
undertone.</p>

<p>At that moment they saw Babillon spring on to the
parapet, rush at one of the soldiers, and deal him a blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
which felled him to the ground. Then seizing his musket
he turned upon the man&#8217;s comrade. But the latter, instead
of staying to meet the attack, fired his musket to
rouse the alarm, and in an instant Babillon had fastened
the rope to the parapet and came sliding to the ground.</p>

<p>But the search party now came up at the run, attracted
by the gunshot, and just as two of them dashed
off to intercept Babillon the leader caught sight of Gerard
and Dubois, who had stepped forward incautiously into
the moonlight in their anxiety at their guide&#8217;s peril.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; he challenged, and in a moment
the guns of the rest of the soldiers were levelled point
blank at them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>AT MALINCOURT AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WE can&#8217;t let him be taken, Dubois, after what he
has done,&#8221; said Gerard under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven, I should think not. They
are only five to four, and we have them divided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feign a surrender,&#8221; answered Gerard, and they
walked calmly up to the soldiers, Pierre following.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, sergeant?&#8221; said Dubois, in a quiet tone
of authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, it&#8217;s you again and Master Pierre, is it? You
don&#8217;t fool me twice with your tale of captain. You are
our prisoners now.&#8221; It was the sergeant, Vauban, whom
Dubois had knocked down in the escape from the Castle,
and his tone betokened intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mutinous dog! do you dare to speak to me like
that?&#8221; was Dubois&#8217; reply in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mutiny or no mutiny, you will come with us and
explain to the Governor. If you&#8217;re not one of the escaped
prisoners, I&#8217;m no man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no objection to that, monsieur,&#8221; said
Gerard quietly to Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are you?&#8221; demanded the sergeant roughly.
&#8220;With so many of your cursed brood in the city, there&#8217;s
no room for honest men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rough words are no proof of honesty, my friend,&#8221;
answered Gerard so quietly that the man had no inkling
of his intention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;A little change of language will do your holy ears
good, if you are a monk,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you wish to take us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to the Governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then,&#8221; said Gerard in a tone of almost submissive
readiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they caught the rascal yet, Louis?&#8221; asked the
sergeant, and the man addressed turned his head to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; cried Gerard, and on the instant hurled himself
on the sergeant, who was taken entirely by surprise.
Gerard wrenched his musket from him and
clubbing it, knocked him senseless to the ground. Dubois,
divining Gerard&#8217;s intention, had edged close to the second
man and dealt with him in much the same fashion,
while Pierre engaged the third.</p>

<p>The struggle lasted scarcely more than a few seconds,
and as soon as it was over, Gerard and Dubois ran to
the assistance of Babillon, whom the soldiers had
captured.</p>

<p>Seeing help coming, they released him and levelled
their muskets at the onrushing men. But Babillon with
ready wit jostled one against the other so that the shots
were fired in the air.</p>

<p>The rest was easy. The two men broke and fled, but
were soon caught and treated like the rest of the party,
in order to prevent the danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the wall,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible, monsieur. The boat must have been
seen, and the further bank of the river is alive with soldiers,&#8221;
said Babillon, &#8220;and they have seized the boat. It
was that made me return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get away, then. Those shots will soon
bring a whole company to the spot. Did the men know
you, Babillon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! then lead us back to your house. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
served us magnificently, my good friend; and that last
trick of yours may have saved our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>They ran to Gabrielle and explained the failure of the
venture, and started to return to Babillon&#8217;s.</p>

<p>It was a galling disappointment, but neither Gerard nor
Dubois was likely to waste time in fruitless repining;
and by the time they reached Babillon&#8217;s house, both had
thought their way to the same decision. They must
make for Malincourt.</p>

<p>Gabrielle wished it also.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two points are&mdash;what has happened there, and
can we hope to reach there safely?&#8221; said Gerard, as he
and Dubois sat discussing it, Gabrielle having again gone
to seek rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would that I had been in the cell with the Governor,&#8221;
growled Dubois. &#8220;It would have gone hard
with me if I had not found a way to end his power to
do us more evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are soldiers, Dubois,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t be soldiers long if the Tiger can get his
way with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin will be up in forty-eight hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-eight minutes may suffice for what he may
do if he but gets his hand on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will not dare to use violence to me,&#8221; said Gerard.
&#8220;His head would pay for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it wouldn&#8217;t put either yours or mine back on our
shoulders, my lord, if he&#8217;d struck them off first. And as
for daring&mdash;what won&#8217;t a madman dare? And a madman
he is. My advice is to keep out of his clutches so
long as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what we have to consider is the best way of
doing it. Tell me, Babillon, what chance have we of
reaching Malincourt undiscovered, and what is the
distance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes would take us there, could we go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
direct, monsieur; but the road is a very open one, and
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he finished the sentence with a doubting shake
of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no other road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur, but it trebles the distance; and miladi
is already overwrought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the devil of it is that we don&#8217;t know what we
should find when we get there,&#8221; said Dubois. &#8220;Mademoiselle
can&#8217;t tramp the city all night. I have a thought.
Let me go and find out what is passing there, and smell
out the chances of safety. Could the rest lie safe here,
think you?&#8221; he asked Babillon.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the night, I should think, yes,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;But I can best go. I could get into the house and carry
any message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can guide me,&#8221; said Dubois, &#8220;and get me a
workman&#8217;s blouse. It is best so,&#8221; he added to Gerard.
&#8220;If Pascal is there holding the house, I can gauge the
chances of our getting in and arrange for him to send
out to meet us. What say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could do it all and better alone, messieurs,&#8221; urged
Babillon. &#8220;One can get through where two may well
be stopped. And if they were to arrest me, I am known
to be frequently at Malincourt. I have a daughter there
in miladi&#8217;s service; and if I were seen every one would
deem it but natural for me to be anxious for her at such
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is wit in what he says, Dubois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; he assented, and then murmured, &#8220;but there
is little to please my wit in sitting inactive here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I cry you patience, good friend? Go, Babillon,
and make all speed,&#8221; decided Gerard. &#8220;It will not be long
now before the dawn breaks, and we must be inside
the house while it is yet dark, if we are to get there
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If all goes well, an hour will see me back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;He is a shrewd, nimble-witted fellow,&#8221; said Gerard
when the man had left.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will be shrewd, my lord, if you fill the time
by snatching a soldier&#8217;s nap. I&#8217;ll keep watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, my lord, let me watch,&#8221; put in Pierre.
&#8220;Watching is my business,&#8221; and with that the other
two lay down on the floor and were soon asleep.</p>

<p>Babillon was as good as his word, and in less than an
hour and a half he was back and brought good news.</p>

<p>He had seen Pascal and learned that the house had
already been searched by the Castle troops, and a small
body of soldiers left to guard it. These Pascal was
prepared to overpower at any moment. Babillon had
found the road thither fairly clear also and had ascertained
the best route to take.</p>

<p>&#8220;In half an hour at most we can reach the woods of
Malincourt, my lord, and the captain will be there with
a strong force to meet us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll be off at once,&#8221; said Gerard; and once
more Gabrielle was roused and they set forth.</p>

<p>Misfortune appeared to have dealt her last blow at
them for that night, in foiling the attempt to escape;
and under Babillon&#8217;s guidance they reached the woods
of Malincourt without mishap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come to the maison, Babillon,&#8221; said Gabrielle.
&#8220;You may be in danger in the city, and you have
rendered us a service I shall never forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, miladi, I will return. Suspicion will
not fall my way; but should there be danger I can then
seek your protection. Trouble is already in the making
in the city, and when the men of Morvaix learn how
your ladyship has been treated, I know nothing of their
tempers if there be not deep resentment and wrath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A timely thought,&#8221; interposed Dubois, overhearing
this. &#8220;A diversion in the town would help us much at
Malincourt.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;But it might lead to violence and perhaps to bloodshed,&#8221;
said Gabrielle. &#8220;I would not have that on my
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, I would rather return,&#8221; repeated
Babillon.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall we thank you?&#8221; asked Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miladi&#8217;s safety is enough reward for any Morvaix
man, my lord,&#8221; he answered sturdily, and with that he
turned and went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a fellow changes one&#8217;s judgment of the men
here,&#8221; declared Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, monsieur, we have many such men, true as steel
to their friends and honest as the daylight,&#8221; replied
Gabrielle warmly, as they hurried on to the house.</p>

<p>There was much to be explained on both sides, and
when Gerard had told Pascal briefly how things had
gone with them, he questioned him as to his doings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder we were not trapped at the Castle.
But no one seems to have looked for an escape, and we
had very little difficulty in gaining admission to the
courtyard. We were taken for a party of the new
troops. Had you come, we should have got away without
suspicion, for I had the sentries safe. But when I
saw the rope ladder pulled up back to the cell, I knew
something must have miscarried, and despatched one of
the men to those whom I had in waiting outside the
walls, telling them to creep as close as they dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; exclaimed Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it saved us from capture. We were waiting in
the shadow of the wall, with a growing impatience I
cannot describe, when the fresh guard turned out and
came on us. The officer at first mistook us for his own
men and was more angry than suspicious; but he soon
saw something was amiss and was for arresting the whole
of us there and then. There was nothing for it but to
rush through him. They fired a volley for assistance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
attacked us; and soon a swarm of men came rushing out
of the Castle. But we managed to draw off to the breach
in the wall, and when they saw we were in force they
stopped where they were&mdash;to my fellows&#8217; disappointment.
And that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what did you do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there came a deuce of a commotion in the
Castle, caused, as I judged, by the fact that you had
escaped some other way and the fact had been discovered.
So I drew off and made my way here. I was sorely
puzzled, on my word. I heard you had not come to
Malincourt, and I posted the men in the woods. I judged
that Malincourt would be the first place to be searched
for you, and thought that if we could let the Governor
feel satisfied no one was here, it might make it all the
safer as a hiding place when you did come; whereas, had
I resisted the search, I should only have brought his
troops swarming here and so have made it impossible for
you to get in at all, besides subjecting the house to be
knocked about for no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was cleverly thought, Pascal,&#8221; said Gerard, with
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more a lucky guess than aught else, but the
guess was right. His men came and satisfied themselves
you were not here and left a guard behind strong
enough to overawe the household, but weak enough for
me to deal with in a few moments. I was growing
desperate at the approach of daylight and still no news
of you, when that good fellow, Babillon, who had helped
me before as it turns out, arrived with your message.
Then I had up a force strong enough to put the Governor&#8217;s
guard in the cellars and came to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we hold the house?&#8221; asked Dubois quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The walls are strong and we have close upon a hundred
men, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; was Gerard&#8217;s eager answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;I would give half the men and choose a weaker
house for more arms and powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other two were silent for a while at this ominous
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean we can&#8217;t stand our ground even for
the hours until my cousin can arrive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are men and can try. But it depends on the
Governor&mdash;if he learns that you are here, and when he
learns it, and what he does when he knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks we are in hiding in the city. We had a
brush with a search party near the walls, and they will
soon carry the news to the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us pray that he remains in that belief; for if he
swoops down on this place with a strong force it will be
an ugly business. We could not hope to resist for many
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go round and see, Dubois,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>Dubois and Pascal went out and Gerard stayed a
moment with Gabrielle, who had listened with intense
interest to the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So even Malincourt is not to be a refuge, Gerard,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are far from beaten yet. Have courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have courage; but how bitterly I regret that moment
of cowardice when I could not face that descent
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have made no difference. The watch was
already set on the city walls and we should have come
straight here with Pascal&mdash;when matters would have
been at an even worse pass. We have gained hours that
may prove invaluable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are brave to be so hopeful.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_244.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;GOD BLESS YOU, GABRIELLE, FOR THIS FAITH
OF YOURS&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;If it comes to regrets, Gabrielle, it is I who am to
blame. Had I taken Dubois&#8217; bold counsels and tried
to seize the Castle when the Governor was in my power,
I believe it would have been best. But at that rate, I
may as well go farther back to the mad thing I did in
coming to Morvaix in the way I chose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True&mdash;all might have been very different,&#8221; she said,
and glanced up and down again, and then smiled as
she added, &#8220;And would you have me regret that too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean that,&#8221; he said quickly, taking her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I care not what happens,&#8221; she answered softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor the trouble and danger I have brought to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something other than danger or trouble,
Gerard; it is of that I think. At this danger we shall
smile together when it is over; and I know you will find
a way to safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means that I had better hurry after Dubois
and Pascal,&#8221; and he smiled again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, it means rather my unbounded trust in you. So
confident am I, that I am going to be quite prosaic and
seek rest. And I shall sleep, secure in my faith in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, Gabrielle, for this faith of yours,&#8221; he
said, drawing her to him and kissing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And God bless you, my Gerard, for all you are to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a long and anxious conference that followed.
The men that formed their guard were picked and
seasoned soldiers who had fought under Gerard in more
than one tough campaign; his to a man, heart and soul,
ready to do anything at his bidding, willing to lay down
their lives in his cause, and burning with resentment at
the treatment he had suffered.</p>

<p>They were glad to have laid aside now the monkish
garb and to scent the prospect of a fight; and he found
them grouped together laughing and jesting in the intervals
of abusing the Governor.</p>

<p>Had all else been as reliable as his men, he would
have had no doubt of the course to take, and none as to
the result. But Pascal&#8217;s fears were only too well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
grounded. Without ammunition the house was little
better than at the mercy of the Governor should he send
a strong force to attack it. And they had neither enough
muskets to arm the men, nor enough powder for the
scanty guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the last gasp we shall have to take the chance
of a fight, of course,&#8221; he said when he had completed his
inspection; &#8220;and the fighting must be done from the
north wing of the house. But we must first exhaust
every other means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that wing we could keep them at bay for a month
if it were only hand to hand work; but the Governor
has cannon,&#8221; said Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must hope that the news of our presence does
not reach him until too late. See to it that nothing about
the place raises suspicions, and if any messengers come
from him let them enter the house and be detained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God he would come himself,&#8221; exclaimed
Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s easy to &#8216;would God&#8217; a good many things,&#8221;
growled Dubois. &#8220;You had better rest, my lord, at any
rate until the day is warmed. I&#8217;ll have you called at the
slightest sign of need. You may want all your strength
for the morrow&#8217;s work. We&#8217;ll set the watch and let the
men sleep too, Pascal. They&#8217;ll fight the better for it, if
it has to come to fighting in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two left him then, and as they stood in the great
hall Pascal said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mind my words in the market place, Dubois,
that a woman had to be reckoned with now. He has the
fever badly. I know the symptoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to, you&#8217;ve had it yourself often enough,&#8221;
returned Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall again, I hope. &#8217;Tis a sweet malady, you
old sour-heart; but it doesn&#8217;t help a man to act; and
it won&#8217;t help us now. Do you follow me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Have I no eyes? I put a plan to him to-day&mdash;to
hold this Governor a prisoner when we had him safe,
and seize the Castle itself. A week ago he would have
thought of it for himself, but to-day he would scarcely
hear it mentioned. He only hesitated out of fear for
her. Love&#8217;s best for a soldier when it crosses him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a sweet and lovely creature; were his case
mine I should feel the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t gainsay it, but I&#8217;ve been married,&#8221; Dubois
answered drily, with a short grim laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that has made you the cynic you are, eh? I&#8217;m
wiser than you, Dubois. I stop short of the plunge into
the abyss of disillusion; it&#8217;s the easier side to laugh on.
But now we must do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty doing before the day ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I propose to find out what is to happen. I&#8217;m
going to the Castle to spy out things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take your life in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as it stops in mine, what matters? I can go
as one of the new soldiers and take my chance. Better
that than taking cold here waiting for something to
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dare-devil step, but it&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; and after
discussing it earnestly they agreed upon it and agreed
also not to mention it to Gerard, and Pascal was soon
on his way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>PASCAL PLAYS SPY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PASCAL dressed himself in the uniform of one of
the Castle troopers, and his intention was to pass
as a soldier who had been merrymaking in the
city and, having just heard of the excitement at the
Castle, was hurrying thither to report himself.</p>

<p>His aim was first to get into the Castle, then to find
the Bourbon commander, Captain Bassot, and explain
the position at Malincourt, and to learn such news of the
Governor&#8217;s intentions as he could, and arrange with the
captain some little plan of action.</p>

<p>He had but little fear of discovery in his soldier&#8217;s
dress. Scarcely any one in the Castle knew him, and
even if the Castle men failed to recognize him as one of
the new troops, it would be no serious matter, because
the captain, when consulted, would soon set that right.</p>

<p>As for the danger, it was to his liking. He was brave
to the verge of recklessness, and the thought of tapping
the Governor&#8217;s plans under his very nose as it were,
pleased him hugely.</p>

<p>As he was indifferent about encountering any of the
search parties who were patrolling the city, he made no
effort at concealment, and covered the distance between
Malincourt and the Castle at a quick speed, thinking over
the matter and laughing at the venture as a kind of
pleasure jaunt.</p>

<p>He resolved to make for the main entrance of the
Castle, and had reached within short distance of it when
he encountered one of the patrols. He was hurrying
by, but the man in command challenged him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;Ho, there! Who are you and where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a mess of devil&#8217;s broth I expect, probably to
arrest. I&#8217;ve just heard hell&#8217;s loose at the Castle, and
I&#8217;m going for my share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one of your men, sergeant. Ambroise Tourelle
of Captain Bassot&#8217;s command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing in the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just seeing how you enjoy yourselves in Morvaix.
You don&#8217;t manage badly. Is the gate open?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the news? Some prisoners have
broken out and half killed the Governor. The whole garrison&#8217;s
in arms. You may look for a warm welcome if
old Tiger hears you&#8217;ve been absent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s deafness to him, then,&#8221; answered Pascal with
a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hurry on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a man back with you lest you lose your
way,&#8221; returned the sergeant drily, and detailed one for
the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say you&#8217;re one of the new lot?&#8221; asked the
soldier, as they went to the Castle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it&#8217;s one your Morvaix girls will know soon, I
warrant,&#8221; laughed Pascal. &#8220;It&#8217;s more to the matter if
you know what the punishment is for being out of the
Castle without leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It mayn&#8217;t be noticed at such a time, especially as
you&#8217;re a new man. If you take my advice you&#8217;ll go
straight to your captain and just tell him the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but where the devil shall I find him? To hell
with the liquor and the women, say I; they get us into
all the troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, and leave us to scramble out for ourselves.
I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take to you, friend; we must see more of one another,&#8221;
said Pascal, with a genial laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>&#8220;I could show you some things in Morvaix,&#8221; chuckled
the soldier. &#8220;Where have you been to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil seize me if I know, but you breed some
pretty faces in this city of yours. Do you know a blue-eyed
wench named Marguerite?&#8221; and Pascal went on
to invent a story for his companion&#8217;s benefit, making him
laugh and swear that Pascal was a man after his own
heart.</p>

<p>As they approached the Castle gates Pascal urged the
soldier to go in with him and find Captain Bassot, and
in this way he passed the gate and entered the guard-room
without difficulty or question.</p>

<p>But the captain could not be found, and, as his companion
had to leave again to hurry after his party, they
separated with mutual promises to meet again, and
Pascal was left to his own devices.</p>

<p>He stayed some time in the guard-room, and from the
talk of the men he ascertained that the soldiers were
patrolling Morvaix on foot and that mounted men in
great numbers had been despatched to scour the country
round, lest the fugitives should have escaped from the
city.</p>

<p>No one took any notice of him beyond casting an
occasional glance of curiosity in his direction, and finding
himself thus free to go where he would, he left the
guard-room and made his way into the Castle in search
of his captain.</p>

<p>The excitement had largely subsided under the strict
military discipline, and so many of the troops had been
despatched on the work of search that he found the
lower rooms of the Castle comparatively empty. The
few persons he met he asked for Captain Bassot, for
whom he now said he had news.</p>

<p>He was sent fruitlessly in various directions, and at
last when passing through one of the corridors he met
Lucette. She was hurrying by with bent head and did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
not see him, so with a glance to make sure they were
alone, he accosted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, mademoiselle, can you tell me where I
can find Captain Bassot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur,&#8221; she answered, and glancing up as
she recognized him. &#8220;You?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad they are no other than your bright eyes
that see me, mademoiselle,&#8221; he answered smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not speak here. Follow me,&#8221; and she
hurried back along the corridor until she came to a low
doorway, through which she passed, giving a quick
glance about to see that no one was observing her.</p>

<p>Pascal followed and found himself in a small antechamber
bare of furniture and overlooking the courtyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the news, monsieur,&#8221; urged Lucette. &#8220;This
suspense is killing. Where is Mademoiselle de Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First tell me why I find you here,&#8221; he said, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you suspect even me,&#8221; she answered quickly,
with some indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suspect is far too strong a word, but I am curious,
I admit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are grossly unjust. I am a prisoner. After
I saw you for the last time last night, I came here to be
with Gabrielle, and was with the Duchess awaiting her
return from the prison, when the escape of the prisoners
was discovered; and since then I have been in a fever
of suspense to know that she is safe and where she is.
The Duke was like a madman. He came to the Duchess&#8217;
apartments in search of Gabrielle, and raged like a fiend
incarnate at not finding her. I thought he would have
flung us all into prison; and he threatened me with the
rack if I did not tell him where Gabrielle was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a chivalrous gentleman,&#8221; said Pascal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;He told us his life had been attempted, charged the
Duchess with having been a party to the escape, vowed
that he would have the truth out of us and make us
pay bitterly in his revenge. The Duchess is a noble
woman and showed splendid courage and dignity; but
oh, monsieur, I was never so frightened in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has not actually ill-treated you; surely, he
is not so base as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He vows that unless the prisoners and Gabrielle are
in his hands within twenty-four hours he will put me
to the question; and he ordered me not to leave the
Castle and placed me in charge of one of his own officers.
But he shall kill me before I will say a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall do better than that, mademoiselle; you
shall leave the Castle. But where is your gaoler?&#8221;</p>

<p>The suspicion of a smile hovered about her lips for a
moment, and her eyes lighted as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you that directly, monsieur. When the
Duke had terrified us in this fashion he called in his
men, and actually had the whole apartments of the
Duchess searched. Oh, it was shameful! Even the
rough soldiers themselves were ashamed of their task,
and hurried it. And when he found nothing, there being
nothing to find, he grew even more violent, and taunted
and insulted that noble woman till my heart ached for
her and my blood boiled at his cowardice and brutality.
And when at last he left us, it was only to send message
after message telling of the steps he had taken to recapture
the prisoners; with lie after lie; first that they
had been taken, then that they were dead&mdash;any tale which
could serve to frighten us, coward that he is. But I have
managed to learn the truth in spite of him, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through your gaoler?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur. He put me in the care of Antoine
de Cavannes,&#8221; said Lucette demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is Antoine de Cavannes?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;Ah, you do not know. He used to think I&mdash;I would
marry him, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those bright eyes of yours, mademoiselle,&#8221;
laughed Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is hateful, this Antoine. It was he who with
M. d&#8217;Estelle tried to kill Denys St. Jean when&mdash;when
M. Gerard met Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil he is! and you fooled him, so that he lets
you go where you will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made me promise not to leave the Castle, and he
keeps watch in the courtyard by the gate. I was going
to him for news&mdash;the Duchess is almost dead with
anxiety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what he has told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They think the prisoners have got out of the city.
They have searched Malincourt and found no one there,
but have left a guard in possession of the house. They
do not think that even Gabrielle will return there, and
believe either that the prisoners have escaped from Morvaix
with her or that they are hiding in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Long may they hold that belief!&#8221; exclaimed Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been many arrests, monsieur. You see
Gabrielle is known to almost every one, but M. Gerard
and the monk to very few; so every one who cannot be
recognized is arrested to be identified. At first they were
brought here, but now they are taken somewhere in the
city. Where are they, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Malincourt,&#8221; he replied readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and I cannot go to Gabrielle!&#8221; cried Lucette
distressfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see about that. You are doing splendid
service here, but you must not stay lest this Tiger should
seek to carry out his threat. Besides, Mademoiselle de
Malincourt would gladly have you with her. Could you
get this lover of yours to leave the Castle with you for
a walk, say in the grove on the way to Malincourt?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;He would take me to Malincourt itself if I asked him,
I think,&#8221; she replied with the air in which she had referred
to Antoine before; and Pascal smiled. &#8220;He
offered once, asking if I did not need some things from
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Be there at noon at the gate by the cedars
at the south end of the gardens, and I will see to the
rest. And now, you had better go. Wait&mdash;one question.
Do you know aught of de Proballe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is with the Governor, and both are away in the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that spy of his, Dauban. When the soldiers
searched Malincourt they found him where I had put him
in one of the cellars, and carried him away with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here in the Castle, monsieur. I&#8217;ve seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil he is! He must not see me. Twice he has
slipped through my fingers, but it shall go harder with
him the third time. He is dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not dangerous to me, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, another?&#8221; cried Pascal, laughing. &#8220;Why,
mademoiselle, I begin to fear for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; said Lucette, using her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a witch, Lucette, with those eyes of yours.
But if you can get hold of this Dauban, lead him away
from these lower rooms for an hour while I am still
here, or you may have one admirer the less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;M. Dauban?&#8221; she asked coquettishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On my soul, it&#8217;s in your very blood, mademoiselle.
But I am shot-proof,&#8221; he laughed, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;At noon, then, by the cedar gate&mdash;that is how we
call it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at the cedar gate; and till then&mdash;good fortune
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a last coquettish glance and a smile, Lucette
went to the door, opened it cautiously, peeped out, and
stepped back hurriedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;Antoine and Jacques Dauban are together at the far
end of the corridor, monsieur, coming this way. Have
a care,&#8221; she whispered hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a hiding place here?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! no, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; then if they come in some of us will not
go out again,&#8221; he answered coolly, and stepping behind
the door he loosened a knife he had concealed under his
coat. &#8220;Leave the door open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette stood where she could not be seen by any one
passing; and they waited thus in suspense as the sound
of footsteps on the stones without came nearer. She
turned pale and clenched her hands and began to mutter
a prayer as the steps came close and the murmur of
the two men as they talked in low tones reached their
ears.</p>

<p>They were discussing the one absorbing topic&mdash;the
prisoners&#8217; escape and the subsequent events, and they
paused close to the open door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you it is not possible, Master Dauban,&#8221; Antoine
said. &#8220;There is not a spot in the walls ten yards wide
that has not one or more soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, now that they are safely outside. Did they not
get out of here? Answer me that, monsieur. And if out
of here, why not from the bigger cage? I tell you they
are many a league from Morvaix long ere this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the whole belt of country for leagues round has
been scoured by our horse. And they were away from
the city within an hour after the prisoners had fled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it as you will, monsieur; but those who could
not hold may be no better at finding. A hen&#8217;s egg would
be hard to find hidden in this Castle, but not harder, methinks,
than two men and a woman concealed in a belt
of country leagues wide and where every man and woman
would be their friend. I speak but what my master
thinks and what the Governor thinks too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;Nay, they will be found in Morvaix, Master Dauban;
and if I were but given leave I could find them,&#8221; and
Antoine laughed confidently. &#8220;There is one in the
Castle, in my charge, too, who knows the secret, I&#8217;ll
wager; and I am but waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be a fat reward for the man who tracks
them. I heard the Duke and my master speak of it. A
thousand crowns will be offered: a goodly sum, but fifty
thousand won&#8217;t find in Morvaix what is not there to
seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand crowns!&#8221; repeated Antoine in a tone
of greed. &#8220;A valiant sum, in all truth, and I know how
it may be earned, and with it my revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two heads are better than one in a thing of this
kind, Master Antoine,&#8221; said Dauban cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But one pocket can hold the reward and would be
fuller than two, Master Dauban,&#8221; replied Antoine with
a laugh, and they passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one in the Castle who knows the secret,
eh, Antoine?&#8221; muttered Lucette when they had passed
out of earshot. &#8220;If I do not read that I am no woman,&#8221;
and her eyes had a light that boded no good to Antoine
de Cavannes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something of the huckster in this admirer of yours,
mademoiselle,&#8221; laughed Pascal. &#8220;He would turn this
admiration of his for you to a profit. You must act
warily, for if he suspects the object of your visit to
Malincourt he may get the tidings to the Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may trust me, monsieur,&#8221; said Lucette confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Dauban, too. You heard how he pricked his
ears at what was said. Mark me, he will watch your
Antoine, or I am no reader of a man&#8217;s voice. And he is
a born spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be at hand at the cedar gate at the hour you named,
and maybe I will bring them both, monsieur,&#8221; and with
that she peeped out cautiously and then sped away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>Pascal waited a few seconds and then sauntered back
in the direction of the gate. He had learned enough and
was anxious to get away. As he crossed the courtyard
luck favoured him: Captain Bassot with another officer
came out of his quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to report myself, captain,&#8221; said Pascal, with
a salute.</p>

<p>&#8220;What madcap folly now?&#8221; said the captain sternly,
repressing astonishment at seeing Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing serious this time, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let me hear it,&#8221; and with an excuse to the
officer he turned aside with Pascal. &#8220;In the name of
the saints, why do you venture here? How is it with the
young lord Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All well, so far. Housed safely at Malincourt yonder,
where, had we but powder, we could hold out against
the Governor&#8217;s forces for days. Can you think of any
means of getting us some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, in broad daylight from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without it we are like to be in a sorry plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no thought of his being at Malincourt.
They are searching for him in the city but believe he has
fled. Hundreds of horsemen are out on the hunt on
every road and in every direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are mostly here. It was held they were too new to
the place to be much good in hunting for the fugitives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men other than ours are here?&#8221; asked
Pascal eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some two or maybe three hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God, what a chance!&#8221; cried Pascal. &#8220;See, Bassot,
couldn&#8217;t we get the men together and while the Duke&#8217;s
away seize the Castle itself? It is Dubois&#8217; plan. While
you are getting ready here I could fetch the rest of
our fellows from Malincourt. It would be a stroke
worthy of us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;A firebrand scheme; but it could be done if the
Duke will only keep the men away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Alembert will be up with the troops by to-morrow
night, and we could hold the Castle till then. We&#8217;ve
every reason, too, to look for a rising in the city among
the burghers; and in that case my lord Tiger Duke would
find his claws nicely cut, and his tail trodden on at the
same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a breach in the walls here. I had forgotten.
A hundred men would be useless there against his
thousands,&#8221; said Bassot.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a flaw in every plan. We should have two
hundred, not one; and besides, if they carried the walls,
there is the Castle. We will try it,&#8221; said Pascal decisively.
&#8220;Find me a horse and I&#8217;ll ride to Malincourt
and in an hour we can be back.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a mounted man rode up to the gates
at a gallop and the soldiers clustered round him for his
news. The captain went across to learn it, and came
back crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor is returning with a strong force. The
man says they have news that the fugitives have been
traced to Crevasse, a hill village away to the north, and
their capture is now looked upon as certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand devils!&#8221; exclaimed Pascal in his disappointment,
and then with a shrug of the shoulders he
added lightly, &#8220;Ah, well, there died a good scheme, and
we must find another. Get me out of this, Bassot, before
the Duke arrives. Just walk with me through the gates,
and I&#8217;ll manage the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed out together, the captain appearing to be
giving him some orders, and as soon as they were clear
of the Castle, Pascal started at a quick pace to carry his
news back to Malincourt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>LUCETTE AS DECOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Governor returned to the Castle in a somewhat
less violent mood. The report that the fugitives
had been seen and identified at Crevasse
was so precise and definite that he was confident they
would now be recaptured, and it was in this confident
mood that he himself carried the news to his wife.</p>

<p>Lucette was with her and had just told her that Gabrielle
was safe at Malincourt, when he arrived, gloating
at the thought of his coming triumph and brutally profuse
in threats as to the punishment he would inflict. As soon
as he had left, Lucette slipped away to put her own plan
into operation.</p>

<p>She did not go to Antoine at once in the courtyard,
but hung about until she saw Dauban and then put herself,
as if by chance, in his way, and when she was sure
he had seen her she made a great show of surprise and
turned as if to hurry away from him. It was well acted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you avoid me, mademoiselle?&#8221; he said, going
after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you speak to me?&#8221; she cried indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine airs for a prisoner,&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a noble fellow, indeed, to taunt a poor girl,
Master Dauban. But have a care what you say. If I
am a prisoner, I am in the charge of one who won&#8217;t see
me insulted. Antoine de Cavannes is a man with a
stouter arm than Master Dauban, any day,&#8221; and she
tossed her pretty head and turned again on her heel.</p>

<p>This had just the effect she had calculated. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
been pondering over Antoine&#8217;s words, speculating who
it was in his charge who knew the whereabouts of the
runaways, and he chuckled now at his own cleverness
in making the discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, mademoiselle; I mean no harm. I am
sorry for you and would help you. On my honour,
I meant no insult,&#8221; he said, following her.</p>

<p>She stopped, but with an air of reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you did taunt me,&#8221; and she gave him a reproachful
glance, with just enough suggestion of tenderness
in it to make him uncomfortable. But with a
sudden change her eye flashed and she cried contemptuously&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You help me! Why you are too great a coward!
I thought once&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no coward,&#8221; he answered, with none too easy
a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have sworn that once,&#8221; her tone was now
regret with the suspicion of a sigh, &#8220;but you let even
Denys beat you.&#8221; It was a daring reference, but she
felt very sure of her power with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lured me then,&#8221; he declared, with an angry
flush. This was her cue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Dauban! How can you!&#8221; and she fixed
her large dark eyes upon him with a look of pained reproach,
changing gradually to indignation as she added,
with mounting vehemence, &#8220;Did I not say you were a
coward? To blame a poor girl for what was none of
her fault, and never to have spoken a word to her since.
Oh!&#8221; and she stamped her foot now almost viciously,
&#8220;were I not a girl you should pay for the cruel slander
and&mdash;aye, and all your neglect.&#8221; Then as if the thought
of his neglect wounded her, her anger passed and she
sighed in sore distress.</p>

<p>He was visibly disquieted, and in an indecisive, self-exculpating
manner he asked&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;But you did lure me, knowing he was there, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Master Dauban, how can you say such cruel
things! I would have thought the words would burn
your lips. Do you think I would have had you
maltreated; you?&#8221; and again with excellent inconsequence
she took fire again, using her eyes all the while with
deadly effect. &#8220;But I am glad now. Yes, I am glad,
glad, glad; do you understand? You are one of those
men who think they can play with a girl as they will;
and you shall pay for it. Aye, you shall, if I have to
go on my knees to beg some one to do me justice. You
shall fool me no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was thoroughly perplexed, as well he might be,
indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you. You are going to marry
Denys.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed recklessly, almost wildly, stamped her
foot at him again, and flashed glances of anger at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry Denys! Yes, I will marry any man now;
any man who will avenge me with you. Look to yourself,
I warn you. Oh, my God!&#8221; and as if in passion
she hid her face in her hands and turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette, Lucette,&#8221; he said, laying a hand on her
shoulder. She shook it off angrily and started from
him. Other feelings were roused in him now than greed
and cunning, and he found them very flattering to his
vanity and very delightful. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this, Lucette.
I had no idea, on my soul, I hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The words appeared to add fuel to her anger, and
uncovering her face she turned upon him, the traces of
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a coward&#8217;s speech; oh, what a coward&#8217;s
speech!&#8221; she cried vehemently. &#8220;Who but a coward
would make such a plea! But I ought to have known
you better&mdash;aye, as I know you now. You spoke me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
gently, gave me soft speeches, led me to think I know
not what, you won my&mdash;but I will not lower myself to
say more; and then like a coward and all unlike the
man I deemed you, you fawn on me with your &#8216;I had
no idea.&#8217; Shame on you, shame on you. I could hate
you for such words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Could</i> hate me, Lucette; but you do not?&#8221; It was
plain, indeed, from both her words and agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not,&#8221; and she held him with an intent look
for a pause until she appeared to master her emotion,
and said quietly, &#8220;I have forgotten my resolve. I
meant not to speak to you again, Master Dauban. It
will be better so; and in time I may forgive and&mdash;forget,&#8221;
the last word died away in a sigh which went straight
to his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;As God is my judge, Lucette, I had no thought of
this. I wronged you. I believed you did but play with
me and took me that evening to the pine-walk that
Denys St. Jean should see us. Why, I love the very
ground you tread on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I won&#8217;t hear it. I won&#8217;t believe it; I
cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s true, I swear it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she looked at him long and searchingly until
the lustre of her eyes seemed to daze him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And condemned me without a word,&#8221; she said, with
a sigh of exquisitely tender reproach. &#8220;Is that how a
man trusts the girl he loves? Nay, Jacques, you may
think you love me, but you would have come to me in
candour and trust, not have flung an angry taunt at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I not trust you? Did I not warn you against
this Gerard de Cobalt? Was I not ready to betray even
my master for your sake? Was I not telling you everything
that evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued to hold him with the magnetism of her
look, and when he stopped she answered slowly and
deliberately&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>&#8220;I shall marry Antoine de Cavannes. He loves me,
I know, and is as true as steel in his love. He guards
me here and will see I come to no harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved uneasily under her glance, and then looking
about him lowered his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not true to you, Lucette. He is going to
betray you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jacques, Jacques, how dare you! Would you slander
him, too? Have a care lest I tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me; what I say is the truth. He thinks
you know where Mademoiselle de Malincourt can be
found and the prisoners; there is a price of a thousand
crowns on their heads, and he means to use you to find
them and win the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Virgin! now am I a miserable and desolate
girl,&#8221; cried Lucette in a fresh paroxysm of distress.
&#8220;Oh, it cannot be true, it cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, I swear it,&#8221; he replied very earnestly,
and gave her a garbled account of what had passed between
himself and Antoine.</p>

<p>As she listened her agitation mounted, and when he
finished she exclaimed, as if unstrung in her emotion&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will never tell him, I will never tell him.&#8221; Then
as if realizing she had betrayed herself, she stared at
him in distress and alarm, and protested with excited,
voluble earnestness: &#8220;I did not mean that, Jacques;
I did not mean that. Do not misunderstand me. I
meant nothing,&#8221; and she clung to his arm with piteous
entreating glances. &#8220;What I meant was I know
nothing. You understand that, don&#8217;t you, don&#8217;t you?
Oh, thank Heaven, you warned me. Jacques, dear
Jacques, I thank you from my soul, I thank you. Oh,
what might I not have done in my blindness!&#8221;</p>

<p>So she did know after all, thought Dauban; and his
selfish love being satisfied by what she had done and
said, his greed began to grow stronger again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Her sharp wits read him like an open book, and with
a dexterous change of tone and manner she said as if
speaking her thoughts aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand crowns! And for a scoundrel like this
Gerard de Cobalt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miladi is infatuated with him and should be saved
from him,&#8221; said Dauban, with a cunning glance. &#8220;Else
she may be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Jacques; don&#8217;t tempt me with such
thoughts. Yet, how true, how shrewdly true! No,
no, it would be vile baseness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would save her from a villain,&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;And for my reward she would never look at me
again. Oh, Gabrielle, Gabrielle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our reward would be a thousand crowns, Lucette.
A thousand crowns would be a fortune for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A million crowns would not tempt me to such
treachery. How dare you, Jacques! I am not thinking
of money, but of Gabrielle. Oh, if she is now in his
power!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money is on his head, not hers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
he were taken, miladi could be left free&mdash;and she would
be saved from him. You know where she is?&#8221; He put
the question very gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, no; oh, I am longing to go to her. I don&#8217;t
know what I am saying, or whom I can trust. Oh,
Jacques, if I could but trust you!&#8221; and she clung to
him again in her distress and looked wistfully into his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear on my life I am true to you, Lucette. Let
us go to her. She is in the city?&#8221; he asked, pushing
his point a little further.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I think what she must be suffering I am
mad. If I could but get to her with what she needs from
Malincourt, I might save her yet. I could take her
some disguise and fly with her. But I am a prisoner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
A prisoner, my God, a prisoner at such a time!&#8221; Her
agony at the thought was perfectly acted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could go to Malincourt,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is Antoine; and even were I free from
the Castle and got what I need from Malincourt, I could
not pass the city gates. Oh, what can I do! What can
I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a permit to leave the city when I will, and
could take you. See,&#8221; he answered in the same sleek,
smooth voice, as he took it out and showed it to her.
&#8220;Then she is not in the city?&#8221; he added, when Lucette
seemed to hesitate. &#8220;They say that all have been seen
at Crevasse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they will not be found, save by those who know
where to look. If I could make sure that only he would
be taken, I should not mind then. And there is the
money, Jacques. Oh, was ever a poor girl so troubled!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could manage it, Lucette, and manage Antoine,
too. Listen. Go to him and pretend that you need certain
things for yourself from Malincourt; say nothing
of miladi, and we will all go together. If both Antoine
and I are with you, no questions will be asked as to
where you go. You can then get the disguise and whatever
else you need for miladi, and I&#8217;ll find a pretext to
get rid of Antoine, and you and I alone will go to
miladi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How cunningly you plan, Jacques; how shrewd! You
make it seem so simple,&#8221; and Lucette thanked him with
a radiant smile. Her face clouded again instantly, however,
as she added, &#8220;But Antoine is a dangerous man,
Jacques.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will manage that. At need, I will have him recalled
from Malincourt, or we will return to the Castle
and then I will get him away. But mind, not a syllable
about miladi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give me courage, Jacques. Let us go to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
He keeps his ward of me in the courtyard, that I may
not pass. You speak of Malincourt to him. You can
hide your thoughts; and he would read mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went then together and found Antoine lounging
in the courtyard chatting with a group of soldiers. He
left them at once and crossed to Lucette, looking displeased
that Dauban was with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have kept me waiting,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that a crime, M. Gaoler?&#8221; she answered
mockingly, with a toss of the head. &#8220;Maybe I was
in better company,&#8221; and she glanced at Dauban, who
smiled self-complacently. &#8220;Perhaps you would like me
to be gyved to you by the wrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearer the finger-tips than the wrist would suit me
better, Lucette,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a gaoler should be a judge of fetters, but I
wear none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not fetters, Lucette; a ring for the left hand,&#8221; he
answered, looking at her with a bold admiration that
was little to Dauban&#8217;s taste.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have come to ask you a question, Antoine,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; echoed Antoine, with a sharp glance at Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;we.&#8217; Lucette has need of certain things
from Malincourt and would fain go there in quest of
them. I told her there would be no difficulty were you
and I to escort her there and back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very thoughtful of you&mdash;but she is my
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be nobody&#8217;s prisoner the moment the fugitives
are brought in from Crevasse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she will need no things from Malincourt,&#8221;
returned Antoine sharply, with a knowing smile. But
Lucette struck in at once briskly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean I cannot go? Say so openly, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
do, and I shall know what to think. It is when a poor
girl is at such a pass as I am that she can judge her
friends. Master Dauban, who knows more of these
things in one tiny corner of his brain than you do in
your whole body, said there would be no difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dauban hasn&#8217;t been put in charge of you and isn&#8217;t
responsible to the Governor. I am,&#8221; said Antoine
sulkily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Dauban would take some risk to give a poor
girl some pleasure, wouldn&#8217;t you, Jacques?&#8221; Antoine
winced at the name thus glibly spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no risk; but if there were I&#8217;d run it, readily
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you would, Jacques. I know a friend when
I see one. I don&#8217;t want to go now, monsieur,&#8221; she said
to Antoine angrily. &#8220;If I know my friends, I also know
my enemies. You are my gaoler, very well; you are
afraid to do a little thing like this, very well. You make
big promises and refuse this, again very well. Perhaps
my gaoler has some orders to give?&#8221; and she looked at
him with angry defiant eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thank you. I don&#8217;t want to hear you. I won&#8217;t
hear a word you say,&#8221; she cried, with a stamp of the
foot. She could put a deal of meaning into that stamp
of the foot. &#8220;I suppose a prisoner can go back into
the Castle. Come, Jacques,&#8221; and she made as if to turn
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you couldn&#8217;t go, Lucette. You&#8217;ve such
a fiery temper,&#8221; said Antoine, all unwilling that she
should leave like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must find it very disagreeable to be with
me,&#8221; she rapped back. &#8220;Come, Jacques,&#8221; and laid a
hand on Dauban&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>But Dauban was now less set upon love-making than
seeking to gain the thousand crowns, and he would
not go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;Antoine did not say you should not go, Lucette; he
only said there was more risk for him than for me.
And that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t wish to go now. I know now who is
not my friend; and that knowledge is cheaply gained
by the lack of just a few things I wished. It does not
matter to him what happens to me: he has his duty to
think of and his master, the Governor. Like Tiger, like
whelp. He would like to see me stretched on the rack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette, don&#8217;t say that, don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Antoine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could listen to my groans as my joints were
stretched, and chuckle to think how well you had done
your duty. I know you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t talk at random in that way,&#8221;
he protested. &#8220;If it comes to that I&#8217;d be the first to
help you to escape. I would, on my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear him, hear him,&#8221; exclaimed Lucette disdainfully.
&#8220;The man would not let me fetch a few tie ribbons
from Malincourt, and yet would risk his life!&#8221;
Her contempt was splendid.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you to Malincourt; aye, and get you
out of the city, Lucette, if you but bid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear, Lucette, he will take you,&#8221; said Dauban,
stopping the angry tirade which was hovering on her lips.</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then with a smile and a
curl of the lip, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, monsieur, you had better not. I am a girl and
you two are only strong men and armed, and you might
be hurt. I might kill you both with my empty hands,
and then escape. Pray be cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antoine laughed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a little devil you are, Lucette. May I be
hanged if I know whether you want to go or not. But
if you do, you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go,&#8221; said Dauban practically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you both feel safe?&#8221; asked Lucette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
with mock sweetness, and then glanced at Antoine with
a smile which completed his conquest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;you always get your way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the courtyard at a leisurely pace and
passed slowly through the gate, the two men exchanging
words with the guards, and then turned in the direction
of Malincourt.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Governor asks for me while we&#8217;re away,
there&#8217;ll be trouble for me,&#8221; said Antoine somewhat
ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he asked for me and I wasn&#8217;t away, there would
be greater trouble for me,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;But if you
repent, we&#8217;ll go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spit such fire at me, Lucette; I meant nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better hasten, I think,&#8221; said Dauban, and they
quickened their steps to a rapid pace. Lucette played
the one man against the other with great adroitness
until they were near Malincourt and the cedar gate was
in sight, when she began to set them by the ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jacques tells me there is a price of a thousand crowns
on Gerard de Cobalt&#8217;s head. Is that so, Antoine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was announced in the Castle and has been
proclaimed in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true you have a mind to earn it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand crowns is a thousand crowns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And blood money is blood money, too. Is it not so,
Jacques?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it has to be earned by somebody, why not one as
well as another?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no flaw in that reasoning either,&#8221; and Antoine
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that why you told Jacques you could use me to
earn it?&#8221; asked Lucette, looking at him fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say that?&#8221; asked Antoine, glancing angrily
at Dauban. He bore him no good will for having forced
himself into this walk, nor for the angry words Lucette
had spoken to him, and her looks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;Indeed, he did. Didn&#8217;t you, Jacques?&#8221; and her sharp
eyes were on him now much to his uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that exactly,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jacques!&#8221; cried Lucette in an indignant tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mistook me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you say then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, Master Dauban, let&#8217;s have that. Let&#8217;s hear what
you did say,&#8221; and Antoine frowned darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember exactly what I said. And it doesn&#8217;t
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, but it does matter.&#8221; Antoine was
growing more angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t begin to quarrel,&#8221; exclaimed Lucette,
pouring oil on to the flames with a dexterous hand.
&#8220;Master Dauban only said that you meant to use me
as a decoy to find mademoiselle, and then I agreed to
help him to get the money for himself if he promised to
save mademoiselle and only capture this de Cobalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand devils! Is that true, Master Dauban?&#8221;
cried Antoine in a voice of rage at this proof of treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what have I said!&#8221; exclaimed Lucette in distress.
&#8220;Oh, Antoine, don&#8217;t look at him like that. You frighten
me. You must not harm him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so zealous for him? Do you care?
By Heaven! look to yourself there, you Dauban,&#8221; and out
flashed his sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Antoine, Antoine, dear Antoine, you must not,
you must not,&#8221; she cried, clinging to his sword-arm. But
he shook her off and turned upon Dauban, who was
deadly white.</p>

<p>They stood now just within the gate of Malincourt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Master Dauban, if you&#8217;ve anything to say,
say it,&#8221; said Antoine in a very threatening tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can explain all this,&#8221; answered Dauban anxiously.
&#8220;There has been a mistake. Let me speak alone
with you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;None of your lies for me, thank you. Speak out
now,&#8221; and Antoine made a step toward him and raised
his weapon.</p>

<p>As the sword flashed in the sunlight, Lucette shrank
back as if terror-stricken and gave a loud scream. At
the sound some half-dozen soldiers came running up from
among the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, messieurs, messieurs, help, help! Stop them,
or there will be bloodshed,&#8221; cried Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; asked one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; said Antoine, looking at them in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re guarding the place for the Governor,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that concerns you. Go your way,&#8221; he answered
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, my dunghill cock. Put up that weapon
and come to the house. And you, too, mistress, if you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare to interfere with me,&#8221; protested
Antoine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;d better go to the house,&#8221; said Dauban,
secretly rejoicing at the interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go you on with mademoiselle, then,&#8221; said the soldier,
&#8220;and do you come with me, monsieur,&#8221; and at a sign
from him three of the men closed round Antoine, and
made it perfectly clear that they meant to use force if
necessary.</p>

<p>At that moment Lucette turned and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have used me as a decoy, monsieur?
Come then to the house and we will see how it can be
best done.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a great oath in his mortification and bewilderment,
he sheathed his sword and seeing resistance was
useless, marched on between the soldiers.</p>

<small>SUSPENSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JACQUES DAUBAN, in his pleasure at escaping
from Antoine&#8217;s very angry threats, hurried forward
to the house with Lucette, unsuspiciously,
and said little beyond a word or two of rebuke for
her disclosure of their mutual plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have said anything. It may increase
the difficulty of getting rid of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I would not have him think he could use me
as a decoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been safer to have told him afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safer? You do not mean you are afraid of him,
Jacques,&#8221; and look and tone and gesture were alike eloquent
of indignant repudiation of the thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid of him? Indeed, no,&#8221; he replied stoutly, but
with a timorous glance over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a coward, oh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and her disgust was
intense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no coward, but prudence is always valuable,&#8221;
and in this way she plagued him till they reached the
house, and as they entered the door they were met by
Pascal.</p>

<p>Lucette gave a little cry of pretended alarm, and Dauban
changed colour in alarm that was very far from
pretence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you recognize me, I see,&#8221; said Pascal, with an
ominous smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Dauban gazed at him a moment and then at Lucette,
and in that moment the truth dawned upon him. He saw
how he had been fooled, and with a cry of rage and
despair, he raised his arm and rushed at Lucette to strike
her. But Pascal caught his hand and thrust it back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, little spy, stay. If you&#8217;ve a fancy for striking
some one, strike me, not a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are not a coward. Is this the proof?&#8221; asked
Lucette. &#8220;Master Dauban has brought me to Malincourt,
monsieur, in order that I may get a disguise for
Mademoiselle de Malincourt, and then go with him to
Crevasse to find the fugitives there and hand over M.
Gerard and the monk to the soldiery after enabling miladi
to escape. He will be able to get me out of the city with
a permit which he has thoughtfully brought with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pascal laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You she-devil!&#8221; cried Dauban, white and trembling
with his passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both you and Antoine had a frenzy to use me as a
decoy; well, you have had your way&mdash;and a lesson,&#8221; and
with a laugh she went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have made a mess of things, spy,&#8221; said
Pascal. &#8220;Give me the permit she spoke of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She lied, as she has lied all through. I have no
such thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, no nonsense,&#8221; said Pascal sternly. &#8220;Hand
it over. I am in good humour as yet, and may not hurt
even you. But don&#8217;t put me in a bad one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; asked Dauban.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you have come back to Malincourt. Will you
give me that paper or shall I have it taken from you? I
think you know whether I am safe to trifle to with,&#8221; and
he held out his hand.</p>

<p>With trembling fingers Dauban drew it from his pocket
and handed it over; and Pascal called up a couple of men
and gave him into their charge. Antoine he did not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
trouble to see, but gave orders that he should be kept in
safe custody, and then carried the permit to Gerard to
consult with him as to making use of it.</p>

<p>Lucette first hurried to Denys, whom she found sufficiently
recovered to have been able to leave his bed, and
having told him all that had occurred at the Castle she
went to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;How calm and strong you are, Gabrielle,&#8221; she said,
when the first greetings had been exchanged. &#8220;And I
am in a perfect fever of restlessness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do nothing yet but wait, Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will happen? Can&#8217;t we do something?
Tell me everything that has happened. I am dying to
know everything&mdash;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle told her as shortly as she could what had
occurred in the cell and afterwards in the futile attempt
to escape from the city, and then the return to Malincourt.</p>

<p>&#8220;They think you are all at Crevasse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So M. Pascal brought us word when he told us to
expect you. I am so glad you have escaped, and to have
you with me again. Now tell me how you managed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette made her recital very brief indeed, saying little
or nothing of the means she had employed to cozen the
two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have been mad indeed to think you would
betray me,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were thinking most of the thousand crowns,
and when a man&#8217;s head is set money-wards, he is most
easily blinded to other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a philosopher you are, Lucette&mdash;about men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so M. Gerard is M. Gerard still, Gabrielle, but
not de Cobalt,&#8221; said Lucette, changing the subject.
&#8220;How glad and proud you must feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If only this danger were over; but the suspense is
racking,&#8221; replied Gabrielle, with a sigh. &#8220;Any hour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
any minute may bring the Governor to Malincourt with a
strong force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But are we not also strong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In numbers, perhaps, strong enough; but our men
are virtually without arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he comes you can hold out as long as possible
and then fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he would leave us a way out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Gabrielle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that Malincourt would be surrounded, of
course, and every chance of escape stopped. We have
indeed been considering within the last hour, whether it
wouldn&#8217;t be best to risk a flight and seek concealment
in the city while there is yet time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of a truth, it is well I came back,&#8221; exclaimed Lucette
excitedly, jumping up. &#8220;Where are your wits, Gabrielle?
They say love sharpens them in a woman and
blunts them in a man; but this does not look like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette!&#8221; cried Gabrielle, flushing partly in confusion
at the words and partly with the gathered infection
of Lucette&#8217;s excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you ought to blush for your forgetfulness when
the man you love is at such a dangerous pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; cried Gabrielle, searching her
memory vainly for some clue. &#8220;What have I forgotten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the passage that leads from the chapel crypt
to the old burial ground and out to the woods beyond.
Were the Duke&#8217;s soldiers swarming in thousands round
the house, that way would still be clear for every man
and woman inside to pass out in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wits must have been dull indeed not to think of
it,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, as excited now as Lucette. &#8220;You
have saved us all, Lucette. We must tell them at once.
That it should have been left for you to remind me of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been in it: you have only heard of it; and
it&#8217;s easy to remember what one&#8217;s actually seen. I&#8217;ll go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
for them,&#8221; and she was hurrying out when Gerard and
Pascal came.</p>

<p>Gerard held the permit taken from Dauban, and greeted
Lucette with a smile and many thanks for what she had
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will clear the way for us, Gabrielle,&#8221; he said
then. &#8220;We can get out of the city, and I have decided
to go at once if you are willing to run the risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but Lucette has done more than bring that,
Gerard. She has reminded me of what, to my shame, I
had forgotten,&#8221; and she told him of the underground
passage. &#8220;We can wait now in confidence for the coming
of the Duke and use that permit in the last resort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are never to be out of your debt, it seems,
Lucette,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go and see that the way is clear?&#8221; asked
Pascal. &#8220;Perhaps Mademoiselle Lucette will show me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How quick and ready-witted she is,&#8221; said Gerard,
when the two had left.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how dull I am not to have thought of it,&#8221; replied
Gabrielle. &#8220;I feel almost humiliated. Lucette hit
me harder than she deemed with her words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has a sharp tongue. What said she?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gabrielle&#8217;s colour heightened and she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That with you in such peril my wits should have
been specially sharp; yet that very peril dulled them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such peril. I have no doubt as to the
end. See, we have first the chance that the Governor
may not discover our presence here until it is too late
for him to force us to yield before my cousin gets up
from Cambrai. Next, we have means of resistance for
some hour or two at worst. Then we have the means to
get from Malincourt should he drive us out. Then again,
we have this permit to pass the city gates. And besides,
we have yet to see that he will dare to resist me when he
knows that I am here in Bourbon&#8217;s name. I have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
fears of the issue; my distress is that you have had to
endure so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you know we women like such trials,
Gerard, even if our hearts are not so stout to face them
as yours? It is for you I fear&mdash;yet not fear; I have too
much confidence in you. Besides, there is always a last
resource.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are very far from any last resource,&#8221; he answered
cheerily. &#8220;But what is the one you have in
mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I who am the cause of all, Gerard; and in
the last extreme I could avert all ill even from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We would die here in Malincourt one by one before
that sacrifice could even be thought of, Gabrielle,&#8221; he
answered earnestly. &#8220;Do you think there is a man of
us Bourbons who would purchase his life at such a
price?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would let no harm come to you,&#8221; she answered,
her tone as resolute as his.</p>

<p>&#8220;How you must love me,&#8221; he whispered tenderly,
taking her in his arms and kissing her. &#8220;You would
suffer worse than death for me; but you shall do better
than that, dearest, you shall live for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God it may be so; but this Governor is a hard
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we Bourbons are no easy ones. But how sweet
to me this thought of your infinite love.&#8221; She smiled up
to him and whispered with rueful self-reproach&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it could not spur my wits to remember what
Lucette thought of on the instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette is not as my Gabrielle. Her heart is under
the discipline of her judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine is all in all to me&mdash;all I have to live for;
or so it seems almost. I cannot understand this sweet
wild change in me. I am as one in a dream when I think
of you, Gerard; self-centred, absorbed, self-lost. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
not thought it possible&mdash;for me. And yet that great
blank past, when you were not in my life, is but a few
hours ago. I seem to have stepped out of the wilderness
with a single stride into a world all rich and lovely with
delight. And it is real.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall always be real to us, dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When these other shadows are past,&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;But they will pass I know. If I have my moods of
doubt it is only the dread lest the dream shall be broken
and I shall lose you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing shall part us, Gabrielle, not even death,&#8221;
he declared earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Not even death. For if I lost you, I should
die. I should wish to die, indeed. And it is that which
fills me with courage and energy to fight out with fight
and conquer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken as I would have my Gabrielle speak and
think,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Some one came then saying that Babillon was asking
for Gabrielle, and he was brought in to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some news, Babillon?&#8221; asked Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not been idle, miladi. The news of your
trouble has roused the burghers of the city, and at a word
from you they will rise in your defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you said aught that mademoiselle is here?&#8221;
asked Gerard quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my lord. The tale has spread from the Castle
that you have all escaped from the city and are hiding
in the hills to the north. That miladi should be thus
driven to such extremities to avoid the persecutions of
the Governor has caused the present tumult, and I am
supposed to be able to communicate with her. Miladi
has many adherents even among the troops of the Governor,
and from them has gone abroad the story of
her wrongs. The burghers have long had their bitter
grievances and have been arming themselves; and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
this last news is like to act as tinder to dry shavings and
kindle the flame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would that we had but some of their arms here
in Malincourt,&#8221; exclaimed Gerard. &#8220;It would save all
other anxieties. Could you get us muskets and powder
and ball, Babillon, think you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone, I am helpless. A word from miladi would
do all; but that might involve the disclosure of her presence
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worth any risk,&#8221; said Gerard decisively. &#8220;If
there is to be fighting, it can best be done from behind
these walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be no rising in the city, Babillon,&#8221; said
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indignation, on the top of wrongs so long endured,
burns very strong, and is spreading like a forest fire,
miladi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be useless and worse, far worse than useless.
Men untrained to fighting, lacking in leaders, and ill
armed, cannot prevail against the Duke&#8217;s soldiers. The
citizens would be massacred and their houses sacked. It
must not be,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It need not be, if Babillon can but get the arms we
want to Malincourt. How soon could you do this?&#8221;
asked Gerard anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could get all in readiness, and as soon as night
falls to give the cover of darkness they could be brought
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By nightfall,&#8221; exclaimed Gerard in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, it would be hopeless to make such an
attempt in daylight with the city overrun as it is by
troops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, let me suggest,&#8221; said Gabrielle. &#8220;Push on
the preparations, Babillon, to do my lord&#8217;s wish, and if
aught should occur to spoil the venture and we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
have to abandon Malincourt, have prepared some place
where we can lie hid, safely protected by the men of the
city, until the danger has passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shrewd thought,&#8221; said Gerard readily. &#8220;And
now come with me, and we will perfect the plan for
getting the arms. I will speak with Dubois and Pascal,&#8221;
he added to Gabrielle, and led Babillon away.</p>

<p>Dubois was found and a long conference followed, to
which Pascal, who had been strenuously engaged in
clearing the secret passage, was presently called.</p>

<p>Both Pascal and Dubois agreed in urging that the
citizens should be encouraged to rise, but Gerard, in
deference to the wish Gabrielle had expressed, would not
agree, and the utmost he would yield was that Dubois
should go with Babillon, taking with him written authority
from Gabrielle to consult with the chief burghers on
the whole position, to judge the chances of success, and
to offer himself as a leader of any movement. But he
was to sanction no revolt without first communicating
with Gerard; and his chief efforts in the meantime were
to be bent upon getting the arms and ammunition so
sorely needed.</p>

<p>The gruff old soldier protested that it was no more
than a one-handed scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot fight a man like this Governor with one
hand in irons, and that the sword-hand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A
rising to-night in the city would mean everything to us
here. There might be bloodshed it is true; but blood has
been shed before and will be shed again in many a worse
cause. Nor could anything really serious happen before
d&#8217;Alembert reaches the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will fight if we are forced in self-defence, Dubois,
but we will not force the fighting from our side,&#8221;
was Gerard&#8217;s reply. &#8220;This is Mademoiselle de Malincourt&#8217;s
matter more than ours, and her will must prevail.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;It will fail, my lord,&#8221; was the answer bluntly spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll try something else that will succeed. I
am quite resolved. Let it be as I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much for a woman&#8217;s leadership,&#8221; growled Dubois
to Pascal as he was starting with Babillon.</p>

<p>&#8220;He might take another view if he&#8217;d had as much
married experience as you,&#8221; laughed Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he lives to marry her,&#8221; was the gloomy response.
&#8220;To think he should sacrifice a chance like this for the
sake of a squeamish girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get those arms, man, and we may have yet a tough
bout or two here,&#8221; but Dubois shook his head discontentedly.
Pascal looked after him and shrugged his shoulders,
as he muttered to himself: &#8220;Your husband never
sees the same light in a pair of bright eyes as your lover.
Save me from marrying, say I, Pascal de la Tour.&#8221;</p>

<p>A soft laugh broke in on his soliloquy, and he turned to
find Lucette looking at him, her face severely demure
but her eyes dancing with quizzical light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you then in danger, monsieur?&#8221; she asked in a
tone of deep solicitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any man might well be at such short range as this,&#8221;
he answered, meeting her gaze and laughing. &#8220;So you
heard me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you calling on some one else to save you from
some dreadful fate, and the thought of any one in deep
trouble appeals to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger it might be and yet not deep trouble. I can
well imagine there would be compensations&mdash;when I look
at you. You&#8217;re a born coquette, I fear, Lucette. I shall
have to read you a lecture or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The experience of professors in any art is always to
be welcomed, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do Dauban and de Cavannes agree in that? They&#8217;ve
had a pretty fair taste of the experience, at any rate,&#8221;
he laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;Do you rate yourself on the same footing with
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your eyes, do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are canaille, Monsieur Pascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some fishermen are so keen at the sport that when
they can&#8217;t hook the trout they are glad to take the
minnows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And some minnows are so self-ignorant they do not
know they are not salmon,&#8221; she retorted, with a flash of
the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fair hit, mademoiselle. Shall we cry a truce?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to ask what has been decided?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Babillon has been here&#8221;&mdash;and he told her what had
passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you soldiers always want to be killing something
or somebody,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Gabrielle is right. She
is always right. She will be able to escape to this hiding
place at any moment and can lie hid in safety till the
storm passes. Men never think a woman can be right
except when she says ditto to what they may decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until I met you I may have held to some such heresy.
But did we not cry a truce? I am waving the white flag
of surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very provoking, Monsieur Pascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are very charming, Mademoiselle Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a soldier came hurrying to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another messenger has arrived from the Castle,
Lieutenant. We managed to mislead him long enough
to get him to deliver his message. He reports that the
hunt for the fugitives at Crevasse has proved fruitless;
the men have returned from there to the Castle empty-handed
and he was despatched at once to ascertain
whether anything had been seen of them here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were sending him back with a message that all
was quiet here when his suspicions were aroused and we
had to detain him like the rest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>&#8220;Did you question him?&#8221; asked Pascal, looking very
grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur. He would say but little; he made a
dash to escape and when we stopped him, declared that
there would be plenty of his comrades here to know why
he had not returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep him safe. That is all,&#8221; said Pascal; and when
the man had gone he turned to Lucette. &#8220;The beginning
of the end, mademoiselle. We shall soon know
now which plan is right, the soldier&#8217;s or the woman&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>They carried the ominous news to Gerard, who was
with Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It had to come some time,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;Thank
God it hasn&#8217;t come earlier. Have all in readiness, Pascal,
to close the house the moment there is any sign of
the Duke&#8217;s approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when all had been made ready against a surprise,
they waited, all filled with anxiety for what was to
follow.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. In less than a hour the
men on the look-out reported the approach of a strong
party of troops, and Gerard and Pascal hurried away to
decide upon the next step.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>A RUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was unfortunately no reason to doubt the
correctness of the ominous news, and for a
moment Gerard looked very grave when he
learnt that the approaching force numbered between fifty
and a hundred troops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there likely to be any of our own men?&#8221; he
asked Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not. Bassot told me that they were not held
of much use in this search work owing to their ignorance
of the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet we might venture it. It would be a stroke.
What say you, Pascal? Shall we let them all enter and
risk a struggle to capture them? We should get some
of the arms we want so badly. They are all carrying
muskets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is more like you, Gerard,&#8221; cried Pascal enthusiastically.
&#8220;A stroke worth making, indeed, and if well
planned easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, then. Here is the plan. Post men to command
the great hall; it is there we may take the main
body of them, and dispose the rest as secretly as you can
in the upper floors. Let no one but men of the household
be about when they come to the door. Let them
show fear and surprise, and, delaying as long as they
can in safety, admit at last that we are in the house.
The soldiers will not all enter at once, but if a search has
to be made for us, most of them will have to be brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
in for it. Let the search go on, and when the soldiers
are straggled in parties over the house, we can deal with
them. Mademoiselle de Malincourt and Lucette must
go to the chapel crypt to be ready to fly should the
plan fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One suggestion I have,&#8221; said Pascal quickly. &#8220;The
shrewdest tongue in Malincourt is between Mademoiselle
Lucette&#8217;s white teeth, and if she would meet the men on
their entry she would be best for the purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will sound her. Go you and post the men,&#8221; and
Gerard hurried back to Gabrielle and Lucette and explained
his scheme. Lucette gladly agreed to play the
part asked, and listened carefully as Gerard gave her all
the necessary instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delay them all you can,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every minute is
precious. There are but some two hours now to dark,
and if we can hold the place through the night the delay
may save everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led Gabrielle to the chapel crypt while Lucette
ran down to the great hall to wait for the coming of the
troops. Their own men were hurrying to their hiding
places under the directions of Pascal and the officers, all
laughing gleefully enough at the prospect of the coming
tussle. But the dispositions were made very rapidly, and
Lucette had been alone some minutes before the tramp
of the men outside was heard, followed by a loud summons
for admission.</p>

<p>Lucette told one of the servants to open the door, and
he was pushed brusquely to one side as an officer with
some dozen men filed into the house.</p>

<p>Lucette gave a cry of surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this, monsieur?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry if I disturb you, mademoiselle,&#8221; said the
officer, saluting her, &#8220;but my orders are imperative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to shoot us all, monsieur?&#8221; He was
young and good-looking she found, as she brought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
battery of her eyes into action, and he answered her smile
with another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite that, mademoiselle; pray be reassured. But
some strange things have happened&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is surely one of them, monsieur,&#8221; she interposed,
with a shrug of her pretty shoulders and a little
grimace of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that we are looking for some prisoners
who escaped last night from the Castle and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prisoners! And you look for them in Malincourt.
Monsieur!&#8221; Admirably assumed indignation it was,
and every interruption meant a gain of time. &#8220;Do you
think we harbour thieves and malefactors here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are no ordinary prisoners, mademoiselle,&#8221; he
replied with another smile. He found Lucette&#8217;s eyes
very pleasing to gaze into.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are no ordinary thief-catcher, monsieur. A
gallant captain like yourself must find such work little
to your taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to obey orders, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And frighten poor girls out of their wits, it seems.
I thought all soldiers were as gallant as most of them
are handsome,&#8221; and she pointed this with a very telling
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need be in no fear, mademoiselle, if you will but
let us do our duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are not going to arrest me?&#8221; and she
laughed, and added as she made more havoc with her
eyes: &#8220;I think I could trust myself to you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mademoiselle de Malincourt here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle de Malincourt!&#8221; This in a tone of
intense astonishment. &#8220;What will you ask me next? Is
she one of your escaped prisoners?&#8221; and Lucette burst
into a peal of merry laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Excellency the Governor is anxious to see her
at the Castle, and we are to escort her there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;You speak in riddles, monsieur. Do you mean that
the Duke de Rochelle invites guests to the Castle with a
file of soldiers to see that they accept the invitation?
Surely I am dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the prisoners who escaped was a friend of
mademoiselle, and she is asked for at the Castle in regard
to the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean you would make her a prisoner.
Then, if she were here, I would refuse to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be better to answer me directly,&#8221; said the
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever know a woman who could, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave I must press for a decided reply to
my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And by your leave I deny your right to question me
and expect any reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please, of course,&#8221; he answered courteously.
&#8220;There is another matter. A guard of men was left here
this morning when the house had been searched&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Searched?&#8221; broke in Lucette. &#8220;Searched? Malincourt
searched! There has been no search of Malincourt
while I have been here. True, I was absent in
attendance upon the Duchess de Rochelle this morning,
but Malincourt searched! Surely you are misinformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as I say. The house was searched in the belief
that the prisoners were here, or Mademoiselle de Malincourt
herself, and a guard was left in case they should
seek refuge here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle de Malincourt seek refuge in her own
house! Monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must know of this,&#8221; he answered smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you are too frank to deceive me. I would
trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good. I do not like this errand, it is
true, but I have no option save to perform it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that, monsieur,&#8221; she said, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
glance that made him wish any one else had been chosen
for the task. &#8220;You have too good a heart to wish to
frighten a poor girl like myself, or to persecute a noble
innocent girl like Mademoiselle de Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several messengers have been sent here during the
day and none of them have returned. I have come
therefore to learn the reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, monsieur. It is very strange,&#8221; and Lucette
looked at him, almost sympathetically. &#8220;What do
you wish me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see the guard for myself, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, monsieur. Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me. You are either keeping matters from
me&mdash;which I assure you will be useless&mdash;or you are
strangely ignorant of what has occurred here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it must be both, monsieur, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; and
they laughed together at the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, am I the guard? Very well. What shall I
tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the soldiers? My orders are to use all
despatch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then I am not the guard,&#8221; she cried with a laugh,
and then seriously: &#8220;I give you my word, monsieur, I
have been in the house some hours and have seen neither
the guard nor the messengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the prisoners, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur. That question is almost an insult!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean no insult to so charming a lady, I assure you;
but you leave me no option save to search the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, again?&#8221; she cried in a merry bantering tone.
&#8220;I did not know the great Duke was organizing a game
of hide and go seek. But, seriously, monsieur, do you
think your party is strong enough? We have a number
of very savage old men among the Malincourt retainers,
and some younger girls than I.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>&#8220;There will be none prettier, mademoiselle, and none
with more biting tongues. I should wish to do it with
the least inconvenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I beg you have in all your men and search all
the wings at once,&#8221; said Lucette quickly. &#8220;I shall see
you again when it is over,&#8221; a true saying with another
meaning than the young officer understood, and she went
away, having successfully used up an invaluable half-hour.</p>

<p>Pascal and Gerard had heard it all from their post
above stairs and were ready with their plans. The
officer lost no time now in bringing in all but a dozen
of his party, and he despatched them through the house
with orders to search every room closely from roof to
cellars, thus falling straight into the trap laid for him
and them.</p>

<p>He himself remained below by the door until he heard
the scuffling sound of a struggle somewhere on an upper
floor. A voice called to him: &#8220;They are here, lieutenant,&#8221;
and at that he dashed up the stairs, the rest
of his men close at his heels.</p>

<p>It was but a ruse to draw him away, and the moment
he had gone, Gerard sent a man to the door who beckoned
excitedly to the troops outside to enter, and as they
dashed in, mistaking the man for one of their comrades,
they were seized, disarmed and hurried away in custody&mdash;the
blow being cleverly, quickly, and almost silently
struck.</p>

<p>Another false alarm was now raised in a different wing
of the house, and those soldiers who rushed to follow
the sound were caught in the same way. Other false
alarms followed in various directions, until the searchers,
utterly bewildered and confused, ran first one way and
then another, only to be caught in the net so warily and
cleverly spread.</p>

<p>At length the young officer with the remainder came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
down to the central hall, and with a ringing shout called
his men to him. At this Pascal stepped toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, monsieur, but I have found it necessary
to detain your men for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a word from the officer every musket was levelled
point blank at him, but he remained perfectly cool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded the officer. &#8220;But whoever
you are, you are my prisoner, and if you move my
men will fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your men can fire if you order, monsieur,&#8221; answered
Pascal calmly, &#8220;but it will be quite useless. You are
covered by forty muskets,&#8221; and he waved his hand round
the place where his soldiers now showed themselves.
&#8220;For your own sake I urge you to avoid bloodshed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, I&#8217;ll not be trapped like this,&#8221; cried the officer
furiously, and drawing his sword he rushed to cut Pascal
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am unarmed and you are too brave a man to strike
me,&#8221; said Pascal very quietly, as with folded arms he
awaited the attack, looking him steadily in the face.</p>

<p>His daring had its effect, and his opponent&#8217;s arm
dropped even as he was in the act of striking, and the
next moment he and his men were surrounded by three
times their number.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe you an explanation, monsieur,&#8221; said Pascal.
&#8220;Those you seek are here in Malincourt, and it was impossible
to allow you to obey your orders. We are in
strong force and, save for this ruse, we should have
resisted to the death. As it is, no harm will come either
to you or your men. On that you have my word as a
soldier. But for the present at least we cannot let you
carry news back to the Castle. You will give me your
word not to resist or try to escape, and I will not ask
you for your sword. Your men&#8217;s muskets we have had
to take, as we are short of arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer made a great effort to imitate Pascal&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
coolness, but he was very young, and this humiliation
before his men was unendurable. He had to struggle
for self-control and well nigh broke down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give no parole,&#8221; he said, his lips trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I respect your courage,&#8221; said Pascal, with both dignity
and feeling, &#8220;and I beg you to spare me the distress
of resorting to the only alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the only alternative, by God,&#8221; cried the officer
desperately, and turning suddenly he hurled himself at
the soldiers who stood between him and the door.</p>

<p>But they were tough campaigners, much too wary to
be caught by surprise, and in an instant his sword was
knocked out of his hand by a blow from a clubbed
musket which disabled his arm and he found himself
in the grip of those who knew how to hold him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, monsieur, but the fault is with you,&#8221;
said Pascal, and with a sign to the men he was led away.
As he passed, Lucette met him, but he would not look at
her, and hung his head that she might not see the traces
of mortification in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, monsieur,&#8221; she said gently, &#8220;but I was
fighting for those dearer to me than life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not fight with women, mademoiselle, and pardon
your deceit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are hurt; let me bind your arm,&#8221; she said
solicitously, seeing that it dangled at his side.</p>

<p>He drew himself up and looked at her steadily as he
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, mademoiselle; the wound to my arm is
nothing, but you have killed my trust in the word of a
beautiful woman,&#8221; and he signed to the men in charge
of him to take him on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for him,&#8221; she said to Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;He brought it on himself, the hot-headed young
fool,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;How brave you are, monsieur! I saw him rush at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
you and believed he would have killed you. And you
were so cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had to avoid bloodshed, somehow, and thank
God we did so. And now, what will be the next move
from the Castle when this party like the rest don&#8217;t return?
How shrewdly you held him in talk, mademoiselle.
You wasted half an hour at least, and now
another is gone. It will be dark before the Duke gets
here after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost ashamed of my part,&#8221; murmured
Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, &#8217;tis all fair in war, and&mdash;some other things.
But I am getting more afraid of you than ever,&#8221; answered
Pascal, laughing and turning to meet Gerard,
who had been to tell Gabrielle the news, and now came
up with her. She congratulated Pascal on the success.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are strong enough now to hold the place throughout
the night,&#8221; said Pascal to Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong enough, too, to speak with force behind us.
If the Governor comes, I shall declare myself to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come after this,&#8221; said Pascal drily. &#8220;And
while the light remains with us we can best use it by
settling the plan of defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were engaged in this when, as the dusk was
falling, the approach of more troops was announced.
The house was soon found to be surrounded and the
Governor himself was seen, with de Proballe at his side,
giving orders to the troops.</p>

<p>After some anxious minutes a demand that the door
should be opened was made in a loud voice. No answer
was returned, and a second demand followed, accompanied
with the threat that it would be forced.</p>

<p>Then Pascal showed himself at an upper window.</p>

<p>&#8220;By what right do you threaten force?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I threaten it,&#8221; cried the Duke, &#8220;as Governor of
Morvaix.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;You have no right, my lord Duke. I am holding it
by command of the Lord Gerard de Bourbon under the
authority of your Suzerain, the Duke de Bourbon, whose
officer I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this Lord Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here,&#8221; said Gerard, stepping forward.</p>

<p>The Governor laughed contemptuously, and de Proballe
joined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out to me, then, that I may pay my homage,&#8221;
he sneered. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you announce yourself before,
that I might have rendered it when you were a prisoner
in the Castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall receive your homage in my own time, and
when I come for it it will be with sufficient force at my
back to exact it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your noble lordship&#8217;s caution is timely, yet a little
suspicious, considering all things. If you will not come
out to me, open the door of Malincourt that I may come
in to you. I am more than wishful to render you your
due. I am anxious, I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the bearer of a despatch to your lordship from
my father, which will prove the commission I hold from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means bring it me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sending it that you may see great Bourbon&#8217;s
seal and signature,&#8221; and as he spoke a young lieutenant
who had left the house secretly made his way toward the
Governor and handed him the paper.</p>

<p>The Governor took it with a scowl and glanced at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any other forgeries?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I await your answer and submission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Submission, in God&#8217;s name! And pray what are
your noble lordship&#8217;s commands for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you at once dismiss the force that you have
wrongfully brought against this house and leave me and
all here in peace.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s peace!&#8221; roared the Governor. &#8220;Here is my
answer,&#8221; and he tore the paper in two and flung it into
the messenger&#8217;s face, bidding two of the soldiers seize
him. &#8220;I have a further answer yet. If you do not surrender
yourself and all in the house within an hour, I
will order my troops to take it by force and burn it as
the refuge of a murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in great strength, and shall resist you. You
will refuse my demands at your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor&#8217;s reply was a threat, emphasized with
an oath as he wheeled his horse round and rode off.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the last chance of avoiding a conflict,&#8221;
said Pascal, as he and Gerard watched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure,&#8221; answered Gerard thoughtfully.
&#8220;We have taken him by surprise and set him a problem,
and he is not so dull-witted as to think the solution can
be found with just a threat and a curse.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />


<small>AT THE CITY GATES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GERARD&#8217;S judgment that the unexpected position
at Malincourt would be found much too formidable
to be dismissed with a curse and a threat
was quite correct.</p>

<p>The Governor was furiously angry, and as sternly resolved
as ever to carry his purpose through; nothing
should be suffered to come between him and it; but the
last few hours had revealed certain obstacles to the importance
of which even his selfish rage could not blind
him.</p>

<p>He had had convincing proof that in threatening
Gabrielle he would provoke far greater and more dangerous
antagonism than any he had yet encountered at any
time of his government.</p>

<p>The first sign of this had come from the Duchess
herself. She had sent for him soon after Lucette had
left the Castle, and after avowing her share in procuring
Gerard&#8217;s escape, had met his storm of invective with a
stubborn resistance culminating in a solemn declaration
that if harm was done to a hair of Gabrielle&#8217;s head, she
would have herself carried in her bed out into the streets
of Morvaix and denounce him and his acts to the citizens,
and if that did not avail she would take the matter, if it
cost her her life, to the King of France himself.</p>

<p>He had laughed at her threats, but they had gone
home, none the less, and had rendered him ill at ease.</p>

<p>More was to come, however. Babillon was right in
saying the city was roused by the news that Gabrielle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
was a fugitive from the Castle troops. She was beloved
in Morvaix by people of every class, rich and poor alike;
and hundreds of them were ready to spend their lives in
her defence.</p>

<p>Those who had not had personal experience of her
innumerable acts of charity and kindness were bound to
the House of Malincourt by ties of allegiance which had
stood the test of many years of turbulence and crisis.
In former troubles their attitude had been decided by
that of the Maison, and when Malincourt had stood
aloof in any quarrel, they had been neutral. And now
every member of every family was stirred to the depths
by the report of her danger.</p>

<p>The Governor&#8217;s agents in the city had brought him
word of this, and the citizens themselves had been to
the Castle to seek assurances of her safety from the
Governor. Hot words had passed on both sides, but the
Governor had found it discreet to appease them by giving
the assurances of her safety and explaining that the
object of the pursuit was merely a prisoner, a murderer,
who had escaped from the Castle.</p>

<p>Hints had been given him, too, discreetly and almost
timorously, by some of his officers that the concern on
Gabrielle&#8217;s account was not confined to the city, but had
also spread to such of the troops as were Morvaix men,
and that reliance upon them in any attack upon her could
not be fully placed.</p>

<p>Considerations of this disquieting character could not
but produce an effect even upon the iron of his will, but
he still saw a way to gain his end without open conflict
with the forces supporting the Malincourt influence. He
could coerce Gabrielle through her lover. If Gerard
could be recaptured he would have once more the means
of secretly compelling the consent which it might be
dangerous to force from her by open violence. She
would consent to be his wife to save Gerard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>And here it was that he found the position at Malincourt
so disconcerting. He did not doubt that Gabrielle
was in the Maison with Gerard and he had gone
there anticipating no more opposition to his entry than
the presence of a large body of troops could at once
remove. But instead of that, he found the maison
barred against him and held by a force which his soldier&#8217;s
eye showed him was both powerful and ably disposed
for purposes of defence.</p>

<p>That he could carry the place with the resources at
his command was not, of course, open to question;
although there would be a stout resistance involving
bloodshed and the loss of many lives on both sides. It
was not this which made him hesitate. But to batter the
maison to pieces and burn it while Gabrielle was inside
with the defenders, was at once to subject her to imminent
personal danger and to rouse every one of her supporters
in the city to active interference.</p>

<p>There was another course open, however: to starve
those in Malincourt to surrender. It involved delay,
always distasteful to his impetuous overbearing will, but
it was less dangerous and in the end would be equally
effective. Thus he decided to adopt it, and at the same
time to keep up a sufficient show of force to intimidate
those in Malincourt. He could easily surround the house
so that not a soul could leave it, and by an occasional
feint could harry those defending it and thus hasten their
submission.</p>

<p>First, however, he would make sure that Gabrielle was
really in Malincourt, and at the end of the hour of grace
he had allowed, he caused another summons for admission
to be made, and when as before Pascal appeared in
answer to it, he demanded to speak with Gabrielle.</p>

<p>She came at once, with Gerard at her side, and very
proud and defiant she looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to understand the nature of the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
you are offering to me, mademoiselle, and the consequences,&#8221;
began the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand it perfectly, my lord,&#8221; she answered
resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are harbouring at Malincourt a prisoner of
mine, and this neither the laws of France nor I myself
can permit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one in Malincourt, my lord, who can
rightly be termed your prisoner. Whom do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who stands at your side, at whose escape
from my prison you connived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the Lord Gerard de Bourbon. It is by
his commands that the doors of Malincourt are closed
against you. And they will remain closed, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They cannot remain closed against the forces at my
disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you as Governor of Morvaix think you dare to use
violence against the son of your Suzerain, the great Duke
de Bourbon, you must act as you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand that that man be given up to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I decline to listen to a demand I deem infamous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish no harm to come to you, mademoiselle, and
if you will give him up, I will at once withdraw my
troops from Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm can come to me, my lord Duke. I am with
those who know how to protect me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood of those who may suffer if you drive me
to use force will be upon your head. I have told you
you can go free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blood of the Bourbon soldiers here will be shed
freely in defence of their master, and for the rest the
responsibility is yours, my lord, not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you this last chance to avoid a conflict.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard whispered to her before she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me to surrender, and I am authorized by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
my Lord Gerard de Bourbon to answer you thus. Cry
a truce for forty-eight hours and we will come to you
voluntarily to the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not give you forty-eight seconds,&#8221; was the
angry reply, and with that the Governor turned away.</p>

<p>He rapidly completed his dispositions for the feinted
attack which commenced almost immediately. It was
delivered with much show of force from four different
points round the house, and was accompanied by a great
deal of musketry firing on both sides. But this, owing
to the darkness, did little or no harm to either party.</p>

<p>The result satisfied the Governor that there really was
a considerable body of men opposed to him, and he drew
off his troops and surrounded the maison, and left instructions
with the officer in command to keep up the
pretence of an attack and to make one or two demonstrations
during the night. Then he rode back to the
Castle, carrying with him the conviction that in a day
or two at most Gerard would be again in his hands.</p>

<p>Inside Malincourt a very different view of the position
was taken. The attack was regarded as the proof of the
Governor&#8217;s intention to make good his threat to storm
the maison and burn it; while the ease with which it was
beaten off only served to rouse the suspicion that it was
no more than the preface to a much more serious effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;His object is to test our strength,&#8221; said Gerard to
Pascal, &#8220;and to see whether we really are in any force.
We may look for the real fighting later. If we had
known, we would have saved our powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could ill spare it. Slight as the thing was, it
has made grievous inroads on our supply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not be anxious. It will last out till morning,
and then we shall go. They are likely to try and
harry us through the night, so that we must be on our
guard, but the real attack will be delivered in daylight,
and before it comes we must be out of the house. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
have gained our end, the delay of a night, and for to-morrow
we can safely trust ourselves to the burghers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have trusted to these walls if only
Babillon could have got up with the arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he cannot, in the face of the soldiery round the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the secret passage. I could go and find
him and guide him by that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the risk, man. If a suspicion were roused we
should have the one chance of escape stopped. Not for
an armoury full of guns and powder would I have that
way discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough; it is perhaps too great a risk,&#8221; agreed
Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan is this,&#8221; explained Gerard. &#8220;We will hold
the maison through the night&mdash;unless I am wrong and
we are to be driven from it by force&mdash;and in the morning
we will slip away secretly, Lucette and you accompanying
us, and make first for the gates to leave the city
with the pass we took from the spy, and if we fail we
shall place ourselves in the hands of the burghers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the men here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must remain until the last possible moment as a ruse.
D&#8217;Artois will stay in command, and every show of continued
resistance must be maintained. You&#8217;ll see my
thought. The Governor knows we are here and thinks
he has us safely caged. In that belief the restrictions
about passing in and out of the city will probably be relaxed;
the search parties will be recalled from the city,
and I am mistaken if a bold front and a slight disguise
will not be all that is necessary for us to get away. Then
by nightfall we shall be back with the troops to read this
Governor a lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Artois had better continue the resistance here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in form, of course. No lives need be thrown
away. The only need is to blind the Castle people. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
when the attack grows serious he can either surrender or
escape by the same means we shall use, the men scattering
and resuming the monkish disguise. Even if they
are captured and taken to the Castle nothing will be done
to them before we are back with d&#8217;Alembert.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were still discussing their plans when the second
feint was made by the Castle troops, and the ease with
which this was also repulsed confirmed Gerard in his
belief that the night would see no serious attack, and
when matters had quieted down and the last shot had
been fired, he prevailed upon Gabrielle and Lucette to
attempt to get some sleep. They should be roused at
the first sign of any real danger, but what they had to
do during the coming day made it imperative that they
should at least lie down, even if sleep were impossible.</p>

<p>And impossible it was for all in the maison. A most
vigilant watch had to be kept, and Gerard and Pascal
were constantly moving from point to point, that no
single precaution should be slackened and not a movement
of the troops outside pass unobserved.</p>

<p>So matters remained until the dawn. When the light
broke at length, the great strength of the Castle force
was immediately apparent, spreading as it did all round
the maison in imposing numbers that filled Gabrielle
and Lucette with consternation.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was for instant flight, indeed, but Gerard decided
for some further delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to wait until the Governor shall have had
time to give fresh instructions to the captains of the city
gates, or we cannot get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Lucette suggested a serious objection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gabrielle is so well known that she will be recognized
at the gates, and although she might pass, any one
with her would be at once suspected and stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hoping that the gates will be open to all,&#8221; replied
Gerard, &#8220;and that no one will be stopped. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
she will be disguised. We shall all be, in fact&mdash;Pascal
and I as monks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they are not open?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we have this pass of Dauban&#8217;s and the disguises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monks do not act as cavaliers to ladies, monsieur,&#8221;
objected Lucette, and despite the gravity of the situation
they smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is M. de Proballe&#8217;s wardrobe,&#8221; suggested
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, we might pass for rogues, Gerard,&#8221; laughed
Pascal. &#8220;But for my part, I&#8217;d rather take the risk and
play monk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I suggest?&#8221; asked Lucette. &#8220;A plain burgher&#8217;s
or merchant&#8217;s dress would be safest, with the monks&#8217;
gabardines carried for use in case of need. And these
could easily be furnished here in the maison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have weapons, Lucette,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;They could be covered with wrappings to look like
staves or some part of your merchandise. There is no
difficulty there, surely. The real difficulty is Gabrielle&#8217;s
face, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the plan,&#8221; was Pascal&#8217;s emphatic verdict.
&#8220;But I would have a change in it. Let Mademoiselle
Lucette and myself, if she will trust herself to me, try
to leave the city first. If we are turned back, or even
held by the guard, it will be no grievous matter; and you
and mademoiselle can see how it fares with us. If we
have to show the pass to get through, we can go a short
distance and I can return on the plea that something
has been forgotten, and can hand it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This scheme was discussed at length to be finally
adopted, and Gabrielle and Lucette were left to settle the
best device they could fashion to conceal what Lucette
had termed the real difficulty&mdash;Gabrielle&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Lucette solved the problem by means of a large hooded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
cloak, such as was not uncommonly worn by the burghers&#8217;
and merchants&#8217; wives in travelling. Drawn over the
head and low down over the brow, it fastened under the
chin, but a little alteration by Lucette&#8217;s deft fingers so
arranged it that much of the lower part of the face was
also hidden, and when she was ready to start, both
Gerard and Pascal smiled at the little device.</p>

<p>&#8220;A burgher&#8217;s spouse to the life,&#8221; exclaimed Pascal,
whose irrepressible spirits were as high as if they were
all bent on a picnic. &#8220;And on the pillion no one will
know miladi of Malincourt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Babillon can get us the horses, that is,&#8221; said
Gerard, for they were first to make for Babillon&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crowns are crowns in Morvaix, Gerard, and speak
the same language as everywhere else; and if he cannot,
I will. Shall we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have told d&#8217;Artois everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I supplemented what you said with an
hour&#8217;s lecture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God we get away and do not find the Castle
men have spread out too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made sure of that,&#8221; answered Pascal. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been out to look for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come then,&#8221; and they started.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would poor Denys could be with us,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him and told him all,&#8221; replied Lucette.
&#8220;He is much better, but knows he has not strength
enough for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard was very grave and anxious in his concern for
Gabrielle, and as they passed through the chapel, down
into the crypt and along the dark, mouldy, gloomy passage,
scarce a word was spoken. But as soon as they
emerged into the fresh air, Pascal, who had gone on first
to make sure no one was about, began to talk. He
walked with Lucette, Gerard and Gabrielle being ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t look like a funeral procession, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>&#8220;If you were as anxious for me as M. Gerard is for
Gabrielle, you too might be solemn, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better settle the parts we mean to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to begin with, we&#8217;d better stop this &#8216;monsieur&#8217;
and &#8216;mademoiselle&#8217; to each other. My name, as you
know, is Pascal, and yours is Lucette, and they are
neither of them names to be ashamed of. What say
you&mdash;Lucette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you wish&mdash;Pascal,&#8221; and she copied his pause
and tone, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Now we must be something to each other,
because we may be asked. Strangers don&#8217;t go riding
about together as we have to; and we&#8217;re not strangers
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am beginning to know something of you, at any
rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And an excellent education I hope you find it. Now,
what do you say to brother and sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might have to quarrel with one another in that
case, or at least be discourteous. Is that what you wish&mdash;Pascal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an excellent imitation of a sister&#8217;s manner&mdash;Lucette.
But as we don&#8217;t want to quarrel, and I am
plain burgher and you Madame Burgher, we might be
husband and wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a loveless marriage, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of them before,&#8221; he laughed drily. &#8220;But
it would certainly be a marriage of convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And many of those are but little more acting than
this. But I think in such a case I should be a scold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you would, but as my back will be to
you when you&#8217;re on the pillion, I don&#8217;t know that that
will matter. How clear the roads are,&#8221; he said, breaking
into earnestness for a moment. His eyes had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
cast sharply in all directions, despite his laughing manner
and words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we shall get through? Poor Gabrielle
is so anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, that&#8217;s one of the troubles. She&#8217;s too anxious
to play her part well, I fear. She&#8217;s not like&mdash;Madame
Burgher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor is M. Gerard like&mdash;Monsieur Burgher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us hope the husband and wife will get their
two charges safely through. We shall reach Babillon&#8217;s,
at any rate,&#8221; he said soon afterwards, as they came in
sight of the house. &#8220;I pray we shall find better luck
than last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they did not. The house was closed, and when
they knocked and Babillon&#8217;s wife admitted them, it was
to say that her husband had not been home all night.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a serious matter,&#8221; said Pascal, making light
of it, as he did of all difficulties. &#8220;Wait here, and I&#8217;ll
go and find a couple of horses somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Babillon could have given us news of how matters
stand at the gates and a hundred other things,&#8221; replied
Gerard uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which we shall now have to find out for ourselves
instead,&#8221; and learning where he was likely to procure
horses, Pascal went off on his search. He was soon
back, riding one horse and leading another.</p>

<p>&#8220;The city is much quieter this morning. I had a talk
with the man where I got these,&#8221; he reported, &#8220;and he
says all the soldiers who were searching the city have
been recalled to the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And about the gates?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew nothing, and I could ask no more than a
general question, or I might have stirred suspicion. Now,
Madame Burgher,&#8221; he said to Lucette, and there was
some laughing between them over settling her in the
pillion. But Gerard was in no mood to see any objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
for jesting, and Gabrielle was so pale and anxious that
Lucette declared it was a good thing indeed no more of
her features could be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for a bold face on things and a laugh if you
can, Lucette,&#8221; cried Pascal, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll soon see whether
an honest burgher and his wife cannot ride abroad together
in this uncomfortable fashion on a fine July morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rode slowly toward the city gate, Gerard and
Gabrielle following some distance behind. Pascal
laughed and gestured over his shoulder to Lucette, until
coming in sight of the gate he said exultantly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;God be thanked, it&#8217;s open, Lucette. We shan&#8217;t be
husband and wife much longer, if all goes well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thought which seems to give you consummate
relief,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, the responsibilities of a husband weigh heavily
on me, good wife&mdash;as heavily, maybe, as the double
burden on this good patient beast. Good morning, monsieur,&#8221;
he broke off, as a soldier stepped in the way and
held up his hand. But Pascal made no effort to check
the horse, and was passing on with a nod and a smile
when the man laid a hand on the bridle and brought the
horse to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, monsieur?&#8221; asked Pascal. &#8220;Cannot an
honest man and his wife pass on his business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, monsieur. All those who are known to us can
pass. Dismount, if you please, and come to the officer
of the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pascal mumbled something in a discontented tone and
then dismounted.</p>

<p>He gave Lucette one glance with an ominous lift of
the eyebrows. She understood the look&mdash;that the check
was a very ugly one&mdash;but with an admirably feigned air
of extreme vexation, she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you bungle things, Pascal. To bring me out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
like this! One might as well have a wooden head for
a husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace, scold, peace. It is no fault of mine,&#8221; he
answered crossly.</p>

<p>And the soldier smiled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>HUNTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PASCAL was agreeably surprised when the officer
to whom he was conducted, a man of some thirty
years of age with a frank face, commenced with
a quasi apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not a very pleasant duty of mine, monsieur,
but you&#8217;ll understand it is a duty. I am here in place
of Captain Boutelle, and my instructions are not to allow
any one to pass the gate who is not known. But as I
know scarcely any one while he knows many, it is rather
a hardship for the citizens. Your name, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal Tourelle.&#8221; The officer wrote it down, saying
the while&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry I do not recognize you, M. Tourelle.
Your occupation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merchant&mdash;chiefly in steel wares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not of Morvaix; your accent tells me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am of Paris; my master&#8217;s affairs have brought me
to this district.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Paris!&#8221; exclaimed the officer. &#8220;I envy you,
monsieur. Married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife rides with me,&#8221; said Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucette.&#8221; The officer looked up with a quick smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon the smile,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the name is unusual
and recalls associations for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil it does! Can she have been flirting here
as well!&#8221; was Pascal&#8217;s thought, but he looked stolidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
at the questioner as he replied, producing Dauban&#8217;s
pass&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can save your time, monsieur, I think. I have a
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The date is yesterday&#8217;s,&#8221; and the officer shook his
head. &#8220;Did you mean to start yesterday? I am afraid
it is no use to me. But I need not trouble you further
except in one very simple thing. There will be plenty
of citizens who know you, and I will send a man with
you to any one who will identify you. I don&#8217;t distrust
your word, of course, but I am compelled to do this work.
And the Governor of Morvaix, as you may have heard,
is somewhat exacting. I am really sorry,&#8221; he said, rising.
&#8220;Perhaps Madame Tourelle will await you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was most courteously suggested, but none the less
embarrassing on that account.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not, monsieur. She has some matters to
see to, I believe, which our earlier departure caused her
to put off until our return this evening, and will no
doubt prefer to see to them now while I fetch a citizen
to vouch for me. For the present, monsieur, good morning.
Accept my thanks for your courteous discharge of
an unpleasant duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the officer was not to be shaken off.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have been glad to speak with her of Paris.
It is some years since I was there. Ah, Paris!&#8221; and
he sighed as if in pity for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I return, monsieur, it will give me pleasure to
see you again. I will not trouble you to send a man
with me, but will bring back some one who will satisfy
you as to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, monsieur, it is no more than a form. I will
send a man,&#8221; and while he turned away to give the
necessary instructions, Pascal hurried out to Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to Gerard, and tell him the way is blocked.
I&#8217;ll find you at Babillon&#8217;s. Go at once, for God&#8217;s sake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
The officer here pricked up his ears at your name and
may know you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette drew the end of the shawl which wrapped her
neck and shoulders across the lower part of her face as
the officer came out and looked curiously at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him, indeed,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, these flirtings of yours, Lucette!&#8221; whispered
Pascal, as she wheeled the horse around. &#8220;Yes, in an
hour, here,&#8221; he added aloud, &#8220;and don&#8217;t keep me waiting.
It is as I thought, monsieur, my wife will return
to meet me here,&#8221; he said lightly, turning to the officer,
who was looking very intently indeed after Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! Curious! A strange resemblance!&#8221; The
words were muttered in a low whisper, but not so low
as to escape Pascal&#8217;s sharp ears, and the officer gave him
a quick suspicious glance. Pascal&#8217;s easy indifference
appeared to reassure him, however. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the man,
monsieur,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And again Pascal cursed his luck. It was the soldier
with whom he had made friends in going to the Castle
the preceding day. But he put his usual bold face on
the matter and with a salutation to the officer went off,
leaving the man to follow him.</p>

<p>The officer looked after him thoughtfully, re-entered
the guard-house, read over the replies to his question,
and pondered them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be wrong,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;But if so no harm
can be done in having her followed. &#8216;Pascal Tourelle
of Paris&mdash;and Lucette!&#8217; I&#8217;ll send the names to Boutelle
at the Castle too, and be prepared against their
returning&mdash;if they do return. No, there might be trouble
that I didn&#8217;t detain them. But I&#8217;ll have the wife followed.&#8221;
He gave directions for this at once, and thus
laid a train that was to lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pascal was cudgelling his wits how to get
rid of his companion, and felt none too easy under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
sharp glances which the man kept casting at him, as
they walked side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I hear your name was Pascal Tourelle, monsieur?&#8221;
asked the soldier suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you heard, my man, but it is my
name. Pascal the First, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been a soldier, monsieur, haven&#8217;t you? I
judge by your bearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Paris train bands. But one twin was as much
as my father could spare to the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twin?&#8221; questioned the man doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, twin. Pascal the Second,&#8221; laughed Pascal. &#8220;A
good soldier he is too; and, like a good soldier, with a
palate for good wine and an eye for a pretty face. Lately
come to Morvaix. His presence brought me here.
He&#8217;s at the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know him,&#8221; was the reply, with a smile and a nod
and a knowing wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You know Pascal the Second!&#8221; and he
stopped and held out his hand. &#8220;Any comrade of his
is my friend, and I can do what he very frequently can&#8217;t,
pledge the friendship in a flask of good wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wonderfully like him, and to bear the same
name is curious too.&#8221; He spoke as if still suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if you knew the devils of messes he&#8217;s got me into
in Paris with this same name which my father&#8217;s whim
gave us, and this strange likeness! But come, where
shall we have the wine?&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier soon found a wine shop, and Pascal plied
him freely with liquor, a second flask quickly following
the first. When the second was still half full he rose
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve no time to finish it, I fear. We must find M.
Grimaud, the leather merchant, who will vouch for me
at the gate.&#8221; He coined the name at a venture.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a pity to leave it,&#8221; said the soldier, eyeing the
flask wistfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t get such liquor every day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good reason for your staying to finish it, while
I fetch M. Grimaud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, if you wish it, I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; and he threw himself
back on to his seat with an air of impatience. &#8220;Be
quick, my good friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go. It&#8217;s too good stuff to swallow in
gulps,&#8221; and the soldier winked appreciatively, as he emptied
his glass leisurely in sips and re-filled it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have a third reason in, then. Luck waits
on odd numbers,&#8221; and he ordered the third flask, paid
the reckoning, and took half a glassful.</p>

<p>The &#8220;third reason&#8221; carried conviction, and when Pascal
next rose to leave, the soldier no longer raised any
objection.</p>

<p>What step to take next was a question of some difficulty.
The experience at the city gate had shown that
Pascal could only hope to leave if some burgher of
importance could be found to vouch for him, and the first
thought was to try and find some one who would do
this. But where to go? He could not tell who were for
the Castle and who for Malincourt, and to look for
Babillon was pretty much like looking for a bullet that
had missed its mark and buried itself somewhere in the
ground.</p>

<p>He was standing in the market place gazing about him
vaguely and debating the thing when a stroke of fortune
came his way. He caught sight of Dubois and hurried
after him.</p>

<p>The old soldier was in a gruff mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;These burghers are fools: you know the sort, Pascal.
Babblers, gabblers, brawlers, windbags, with never an
ounce of resolution in the lot,&#8221; he said in reply to Pascal&#8217;s
question as to how he had fared with them. &#8220;A
cataract of talk and nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I want one of them to come and talk now,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
and Pascal told him what had occurred and what was
needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come and make you a speech, a round hundred
of &#8217;em,&#8221; said Dubois, with a gesture of contempt.
&#8220;But I would not trust to one of them to act like a
sensible man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can you find one to identify Gerard and get him
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They&#8217;d think I had some underhand plan and
waste half the day in talking about it, and another half
in making up their minds and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, man, don&#8217;t take example by them or you&#8217;ll split
my ear drums with your growling. Can it be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Babillon might do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere out of the reach of their cackling. They&#8217;re
going to meet again at mid-day for some more babble&mdash;babble.
Why did you all leave Malincourt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor surrounded it and made two attempts
to get it in the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These wise men say they waited on him after the
firing and he assured them there was to be nothing more
done, and that he intended simply to sit down before
the maison and wait for you all to come out. To starve
you out, that meant. He&#8217;s recalled all the search parties;
you can see that for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re out now, and want to leave the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you to be found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Babillon&#8217;s house. You know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have been safer in the maison. I&#8217;ll do this.
I&#8217;ll try and find Babillon, and if I succeed in getting
some one to vouch for you, will come to this house.
You had better go there and explain things, and what
mouthing numskulls these precious burghers are.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better arrange some place of safety in case we
have to leave Babillon&#8217;s and can&#8217;t get from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be safe enough where you are, if what they
say is true, that the Governor thinks you are all still in
the maison and means to keep you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll lose no time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I a burgher?&#8221; and with this last growl he went
away, while Pascal, with a laugh, hurried to Babillon&#8217;s,
and reported how matters had gone, and that there was
nothing to do but to wait.</p>

<p>When a chance offered he spoke to Lucette alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have said nothing yet, but I am not quite easy
about that officer, Lucette. He was very curious about&mdash;Madame
Burgher; do you think he can have recognized
you? Does he know you well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it M. Burgher questioning now?&#8221; she asked, with
a glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We&#8217;ve dropped that; and we&#8217;re waiting to
see what next. Just now it&#8217;s some one a good deal in
earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he used to know me very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he another of them?&#8221; He could not resist the
jest, and she laughed back with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t of course understand that. I won&#8217;t, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think he can have sent any one after you
to make sure you were Madame Burgher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> think so?&#8221; She was serious now. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get rid of the horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Gerard did that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must speak to him then. A very little slip may
have very big results to-day.&#8221; He called Gerard aside
and told him his doubts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took the horses back to where you hired them. I
dared not leave them standing here. I passed a couple
of soldiers, but they took no notice of me; and of course
I made sure that no one followed me here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;It may be nothing, but when that soldier gets back
and this tale gets carried to the Castle about the two Pascals
and the one Lucette, it may be something&mdash;especially
if de Proballe&#8217;s cunning ears get wind of it. I
wish you were away.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were very soon to have proof that Pascal&#8217;s uneasiness
had only too solid grounds. They waited with
much impatience for Dubois&#8217; coming, and when he came,
about an hour after noon, he brought a grave face and
very serious news.</p>

<p>The city gates had been shut again and the Governor&#8217;s
troops were once more searching the city; this
time systematically from house to house, and the efforts
of the search parties were being in the first place concentrated
on that part of the city in which Babillon&#8217;s
house stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I passed them at their work,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and only
wonder I was not stopped. You cannot stay here, or
you will be trapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one course then,&#8221; decided Gerard.
&#8220;We must get back to Malincourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a better plan,&#8221; said Gabrielle. &#8220;Do you
go alone, Gerard, in your monk&#8217;s gabardine. He has
passed the soldiers, and you will do so. I will wait for
their coming. We know from what Babillon told us
yesterday and what Captain Dubois has heard from the
burghers, that no harm can come to me. Please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Gerard firmly. &#8220;One thing I will
not do. I will not leave you within that madman&#8217;s
reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is you he seeks. Would it not be safer, Captain
Dubois, for him to go alone? And you, M. Pascal,
what say you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be safer,&#8221; agreed the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dubois!&#8221; exclaimed Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak but my opinion, my lord. I should take
miladi&#8217;s advice. I will answer for her safety.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>&#8220;I cannot consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be too late to do anything if we dally in
talking,&#8221; said Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will go together, but I will change my burgher&#8217;s
dress for a monk&#8217;s,&#8221; and he hurried from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only a monk outwardly, and it may be well to
have an officer among the party,&#8221; said Dubois, slipping
off his gabardine and revealing his uniform under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221; said Pascal, who was at the window as
Gerard re-entered. &#8220;The soldiers are already in the
street. The chance is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard looked very grave and Dubois smothered an
oath in his moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to pay a heavy price for our mistake
in leaving Malincourt,&#8221; exclaimed Gerard. &#8220;Still, we
can but make the attempt. Come, Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur, may I suggest?&#8221; put in Lucette hurriedly.
&#8220;There is a chance that these searchers may not know
Gabrielle. Let M. Pascal and me remain here to wait
for them, playing your parts, while you hide somewhere
in the house. When they find us, they may be satisfied
to search no further than this room, and you will be
free to leave when they have gone. If M. Pascal will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well suggested,&#8221; declared Pascal. &#8220;If they will
not know you, mademoiselle,&#8221; he added, with a quizzing
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know all the officers, monsieur,&#8221; she retorted.</p>

<p>Gerard and Gabrielle both protested against the plan
on the ground of its danger to Lucette; but this was
overborne, and the two were left alone, while Gerard,
Gabrielle and Dubois went with Madame Babillon to an
upper part of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather reversing the due order, this, Lucette,&#8221; said
Pascal lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Due order?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>&#8220;Man and wife an hour or two back, and now we&#8217;re
only betrothed, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Pascal!&#8221; she cried, laughing and blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your leave, not Pascal, but Gerard&mdash;Gabrielle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what we ought to be doing when they
come. I fear my heart is beating rather wildly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fitting its beats to the occasion, that&#8217;s all. As to
what we should do, can&#8217;t you find a suggestion out of
your experience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we ought to be making love&mdash;Gabrielle.
That&#8217;s what Gerard would be doing, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing one thing that&#8217;s right, at any rate.
We&#8217;re talking nonsense&mdash;Gerard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think we ought to play our parts thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you treat everything as a jest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when I&#8217;m Gerard to your Gabrielle. It&#8217;s a part
I could play in real earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Gerard is an extremely ridiculous person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I think Gabrielle a very charming&mdash;coquette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they would come, and get it over. I&#8217;m a sad
coward, and am getting more frightened every minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re anxious to break the engagement. You&#8217;ll
break your Gerard&#8217;s heart.&#8221; He was listening intently
for the coming of the soldiers, and jested merely that
he might distract her thoughts and keep up her spirits.
&#8220;It will be awkward, by the way, if the officer in charge
happens to be&mdash;another of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to think the list a long one,&#8221; she retorted
with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see. To begin with&#8221;&mdash;and he made as if to
tell them off on his fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, thank you. I can count for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes make me almost wish I could count
myself,&#8221; he laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;If my eyes were speaking my thoughts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked, for she stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;They would be asking how many hands would be
needed to count&mdash;my Gerard&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my hands have long been full. Wait. I hear
them,&#8221; he broke off, in the midst of a laugh. &#8220;You had
better be in my arms and, when the door opens, break
away and utter my name&mdash;I mean Gerard; and then act
as though it was what it will be&mdash;a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tramp of men entering the house was heard, and
he put his arm round her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look sad,&#8221; he whispered hurriedly. &#8220;For God&#8217;s
sake, don&#8217;t smile like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oughtn&#8217;t I to like to have your arm round me? You
are very clumsy about it, you know&mdash;Gerard. One
might think you had had no practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know how things should be done,&#8221; he
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart is beating like a wild thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a heavy hand was thrust against the
door, which was flung open, and the soldiers entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerard!&#8221; cried Lucette, &#8220;look, look, the soldiers,&#8221;
and then staring wildly at the men, she clapped her hand
to her lips and with a cry of fear fell into a seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, Gabrielle, it is nothing,&#8221; he whispered, in
a tone loud enough to be heard, and bent for a moment
over her as if in deep concern. Then he turned to the
men. &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he demanded angrily.
With intense satisfaction he recognized two of his own
men among the five who were in charge of a sergeant,
and he shot at them a warning look.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that we&#8217;re in luck, monsieur, I think. You
must come with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with you? Why? Cannot an honest merchant
be about his business without you soldiers hunting
him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>&#8220;Your name, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tourelle. Leave me in peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Christian name, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal. You are an insolent fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mademoiselle&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no concern of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard it, monsieur, and yours too. Gerard the one
and Gabrielle the other. That is enough for me. You
must come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. Don&#8217;t you dare to lay a finger on me,&#8221;
and he made as if to offer a resistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can explain to those at the Castle, monsieur.
I can only obey orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You touch me at your peril. I am an honest
burgher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, monsieur. You can see that,&#8221; and at a
sign from him two of the men stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall pay dearly for this outrage, and if I had
a weapon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but you haven&#8217;t,&#8221; was the blunt reply; and the
two soldiers laid their hands on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you also, mademoiselle, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little comedy was well acted to the end, and Pascal,
full of protests, and Lucette in tears, were led away; the
sergeant unable to repress a smile of intense satisfaction
at the capture.</p>

<p>They had not been gone long before the others came
back to the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ruse has answered, then,&#8221; said Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;How brave of Lucette,&#8221; exclaimed Gabrielle. &#8220;I
trust no harm will come to her for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot. It is but a few hours now before we shall
be in command of the town and the Castle itself. And
those hours will be consumed by this search. Can we
go, Dubois?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should wait a while.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;I am in a fever to reach Malincourt,&#8221; replied Gerard
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not counsel our going so far. Could you
not find shelter in some house already searched? Indeed,
why not remain here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could find shelter anywhere in Morvaix,&#8221; declared
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then think of some place, mademoiselle. They have
been working from east to west, so that all east of this
is safe. There were two of our men in the party just
now,&#8221; said Dubois, turning to Gerard. &#8220;They must be
using them to make up the number necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I decide for Malincourt and should like an
escort of them to take us there,&#8221; he answered, and then
asked again whether they could start.</p>

<p>Dubois went to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand hells!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They are coming
back here. They must have found out the mistake.
Quick, my lord, to your hiding place again! No, no, by
Heaven! what fortune. Four out of five of the men are
ours. I see a way. Hide, but close at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair while Gerard and Gabrielle
left the room.</p>

<p>The soldiers came hurrying in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; he asked coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a question I should put to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the officer in charge of the search party. We
are looking for the escaped prisoners, and my sergeant
has just been fooled in this house. Now, monsieur, who
are you? And do you know of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Captain Dubois, comrade of Captain Bassot, in
charge of the recently arrived troops. These are some
of my men, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything of this trick?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; exclaimed Dubois angrily. &#8220;Of what
do you accuse me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I make no accusation, captain. But I have to search
the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, send your men to search it,&#8221; and Dubois got up
and stood by the door, thus barring the way out of the
house. If the officer sent the Bourbon men they would
find nothing, he knew; if he went himself, he would find
more than he would be allowed to take away.</p>

<p>The officer hesitated a moment and then decided&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll search for myself and trust my own eyes this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all one to me,&#8221; answered Dubois with a shrug.</p>

<p>Three men were called on to accompany the officer,
and all four were leaving the room, when Gerard, who
had heard what had passed, met him at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; was the officer&#8217;s significant exclamation at
sight of him, &#8220;as I thought,&#8221; and he turned with a smile
of triumph to Dubois.</p>

<p>But the smile died away instantly.</p>

<p>Dubois was standing before the door with his drawn
sword in his hand.</p>

<p>It was he who smiled now, and a grim, significant,
dangerous smile it was.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />


<small>A RISING AND ITS SEQUEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE officer stared with growing anger, first at
Dubois, then back at Gerard, and lastly at the
four of his men who had moved away and left
him and the one Castle soldier alone in the middle of
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this mutiny?&#8221; he cried furiously, drawing his
sword.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that,&#8221; said Dubois. &#8220;It would be a
mutiny if they were to turn against their own officer.
And they will not. This is my doing, and the responsibility
is mine. I will not let you take your prisoners
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see to that. Jean, if that man does not stand
from the door, you will fire at him.&#8221; The musket was
levelled. &#8220;Now, monsieur, if you please, stand from the
door,&#8221; he cried sternly.</p>

<p>But the musket was not fired. Gerard stepped swiftly
behind the man, seized his weapon and dragged it from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can have no firing here,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will resist capture at your peril;&#8221; and the officer
turned on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite prepared for that, captain,&#8221; interposed
Dubois; &#8220;but it is you who are in peril, not we. You
will give me your sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer appealed almost fiercely to the four men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to stand by and witness this? You will
pay for it if you do with your lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My soldiers are not trained to man-hunting, monsieur,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
said Dubois. &#8220;Come, we have wasted enough
time. Will you surrender to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was a swift rush and an attack, which
Dubois parried with the coolness of a wary and practised
fencer. The four soldiers looked on stolidly, and the
one who had been disarmed watched the duel with the
staring gaze of bewilderment and alarm.</p>

<p>It lasted but a minute or two, when Dubois, forcing
the fight with irresistible vigour, drove his antagonist
back till, stepping on the fallen musket, he tripped and
fell, and his sword went clattering out of his hand over
the boards.</p>

<p>Dubois picked it up, and sheathed his own weapon.
At that moment the Castle soldier made a dash for the
door to escape, only to be stopped by two of the Bourbon
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have driven me to this, monsieur,&#8221;
said Dubois in a tone of quiet authority. The officer
had risen and stood with folded arms, his face flushed
with anger and his brow sullen with the chagrin and
humiliation of his ignominious failure. &#8220;You must
accompany me. No harm will come to you if you obey.
But we are resolute men, and our lives may be at stake.&#8221;
He signed to his own soldiers to bring the prisoner
along, and all left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he going to do, Gerard?&#8221; asked Gabrielle.
&#8220;How terrible he looked in that fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a strenuous antagonist to face at such a time;
but he meant only to disarm the other. He could have
killed him half a dozen times had he been so minded.
He has done splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what next? We cannot stay here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, for we shall have more of the Castle
men here soon to learn the cause of the delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can have happened to Lucette? Dear, brave
Lucette.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>&#8220;We are fast nearing the end of our troubles, Gabrielle.
D&#8217;Alembert should be up by nightfall at latest if
all has gone well with our couriers, and we ought to be
in Malincourt within an hour, where we can wait for
him in safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dubois and the four soldiers returned then, Dubois
dressed in the uniform of a Castle man; and Gabrielle
could not restrain a little cry of astonishment at recognizing
him, while Gerard smiled as he divined his intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan is, my lord, that we use our men and play
the guard to escort you and mademoiselle as prisoners
through the streets. We have secured the captain and
his man, so that they can give us no trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a good plan it is, Dubois,&#8221; agreed Gerard. &#8220;We
are well through an ugly business, thanks to you. The
sooner we start the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about two hours after noon when they left
Babillon&#8217;s house; but while they had been sheltered there
events had occurred which had set the whole of the little
city in a ferment.</p>

<p>The first cause had been slight: a very trifle; no
more than the young lieutenant&#8217;s curiosity at Lucette&#8217;s
name at the attempt to pass the gate. He had, in the
first place, sent men to follow her; and although she had
reached Gerard and Gabrielle and got well away undiscovered,
the pursuit had been far from fruitless. Two
of the men loitering about had seen Gerard when he
returned with the horses.</p>

<p>They were making their report of this when the soldier
whom Pascal had tricked returned without him, and in
a semi-intoxicated muddle had told the story of two
Pascals. Alarmed by this, the lieutenant had sent at
once to the Castle, with the result that instant and most
vigorous measures were taken to trace the fugitives.
The fact that the horses had been obtained at no great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
distance from Babillon&#8217;s house caused that district to be
searched first, while large numbers of patrol parties were
sent through the city.</p>

<p>This step roused the citizens again, and despite
Dubois&#8217; opinion as to the indecision of the burgher leaders,
they had resolved to take active measures; while
the bulk of the citizens, inflamed by their long-standing
wrongs, were quickly on fire when the soldiers turned
out and the news spread that they were hunting for
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>All the elements for a collision were thus present, and
the streets were thronged with the people, who eyed the
soldiers with lowering looks of deadly hate, and needed
but a little provocation to drive them to open and violent
revolt.</p>

<p>And that provocation the Governor himself afforded
at the very time when Gerard and his little party were
endeavouring to escort Gabrielle to Malincourt.</p>

<p>The Governor, hearing of the danger of trouble in the
city, hurried from the Castle with the intention of conferring
with the chief burghers and renewing the assurances
already given that no harm threatened Gabrielle;
and he chanced to reach the market place just when the
crowd was in its most dangerous temper.</p>

<p>In the centre of the market place the officers who were
conducting the search had taken up a position, guarded
by a number of troops, and to them all the prisoners captured
by the patrols and search parties were brought for
purposes of identification. The crowd, constantly swelling
in numbers, watched the proceedings with intense
indignation. Jeers and groans greeted the arrival of
every prisoner, and loud flouting laughter went up whenever
a prisoner was identified and released, accompanied
by threatening murmurs of discontent and anger.</p>

<p>At length stones began to be thrown, and when one
struck the officer in command in the face the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
raised a wild shout of delight. Smarting under the
blow, he ordered the crowd to be charged. Several were
wounded, and the sight so enraged the rest that volleys
of stones came from other directions just as the Governor
rode up.</p>

<p>His first command was for the market place to be
cleared. This was done, for the crowd broke and fled
before the weapons of the troops; and a great number
of the citizens were caught, stones in hand, and brought
back to the Governor. His temper was up now, and
threatening them with heavy punishment, he ordered
the whole of them to be marched to the Castle by the
troops.</p>

<p>The fear of a rescue necessitated the escort being very
heavy, and this step left the troops round him comparatively
weak in numbers. When the crowd began to
return, some one was quick to perceive this weakness,
and called on the rest, who came surging back in great
strength. A very ugly rush followed almost immediately,
which the troops found great difficulty in resisting,
as the crowd had now armed themselves with staves
and bars and such crude weapons as they had been able
to snatch up in the hurry. Some very hot fighting ensued,
in which fierce blows were given and taken on
both sides, and the soldiers seemed likely to be overpowered.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture, just as messengers had been
sent to bring up more troops, that Gerard&#8217;s little party
reached the market place close to the point near the
statue, where the Governor stood watching the fray with
very anxious eyes as he saw his soldiers being beaten
down one by one. The crowd seemed to grow in numbers
and fierceness every moment, until after a last desperate
rush the soldiers turned and scattered in all directions
to be hustled, struck down and lost in the surging
mass of the people, whose leaders had possessed themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
of the soldiers&#8217; weapons, and now threatened the
Governor himself and the handful of men who were
clustered round him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long live Malincourt! Long live Malincourt!
Down with the Tyrant! Remember our wrongs!&#8221;
were the cries in hundreds of strenuous voices on all
sides; and after a hot exchange of words between the
leaders and the Governor, one of those near him was
struck, and the blow was the signal for an attack on the
rest, who were beaten back helpless against the resistless
anger of the populace. It appeared certain that the next
moment would see the Governor himself in the hands of
the crowd, whose passions, nurtured on their long endured
wrongs and whetted now by their victory, were
roused to such a pitch of fury that they would have torn
him to pieces.</p>

<p>The Governor, now fear-filled and terror-cowed, stood
shrinking against the statue from the sea of angry
menacing faces which glared round him when Gerard,
who had forced his way through the throng, sprang
between the cowering figure and the mob, and with
uplifted hand cried in a commanding voice that rose
above the din&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle de Malincourt is safe. She is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to where, on the fringe of the crowd,
Gabrielle stood with Dubois; and for a moment there
was a lull in the storm as the crowd craned their necks
for a glimpse of her.</p>

<p>But the sense of wrong, the thirst for vengeance, the
hate of the Tyrant and the sight of him now almost
within touch of the hands outstretched to seize him, soon
re-kindled the flame, and the clamour broke out again,
and now was directed also against this daring monk
who stood between them and their prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with the monk! Death to the Tyrant!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry began near at hand, and was caught up by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
those round until it swelled into a loud roar, vehement,
menacing and perilous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save me, save me,&#8221; said the Governor, cowering now
between the statue and Gerard, who, undaunted by the
angry faces and clenched and threatening hands, faced
the mob, and again sent his voice ringing like a clarion
among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace! Are ye men that would do this violence?
Miladi of Malincourt is safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more his commanding presence and fearless
calm stilled them for a pause; and before the storm
could break out again a strange change came.</p>

<p>Gabrielle had seen Gerard&#8217;s peril, and believing that
he would be the next victim of the mob, had made herself
known to the people around her, who broke out into
shouts of joy, and amid a storm of cries and cheers she
passed through the ranks, mounted the steps of the
statue and took her stand by Gerard&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>A thunder of cheers greeted her appearance, and the
air was rent with cries of &#8220;Long live Malincourt!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the danger was not over yet, for when the Governor,
gathering some courage from the changed temper
of the mob, showed himself for a moment at Gabrielle&#8217;s
side, the cheers changed with ominous suddenness to
shouts and execrations and groans in the same deafening
clamour.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, save me from them,&#8221; he said, shrinking
again behind Gerard. &#8220;They will tear me to
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May we promise them an end to their sufferings?&#8221;
asked Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, anything. I will do anything. My God,
anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with the Tyrant. Give him to us. Death
to the Tiger of Morvaix!&#8221; came the cries, with even
fiercer vehemence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>Again Gerard stood with uplifted hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Miladi of Malincourt will
speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the cheers came again as Gabrielle, with
heightened colour, waited for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you listen to me. I bring you peace, and in
the name of the Governor I promise you an end to your
wrongs and sufferings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheers rang out again, and as they died down
some voices called: &#8220;We are starving. What of the
tax on our food?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be repealed,&#8221; said the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor pledges his word it shall be repealed,&#8221;
cried Gabrielle. A deafening storm of wild joyous
shouts burst out with mighty cries of &#8220;God bless Malincourt!
Long live Miladi of Malincourt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he keep his promise?&#8221; cried a stentorian voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pledge my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard repeated this in his ringing tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Governor pledges his honour as a noble of
France to repeal the tax&mdash;a pledge no man dare break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have saved my life, mademoiselle, you and this
monk,&#8221; said the Governor, not recognizing Gerard, who
had kept his face carefully averted, and now drew his
cowl closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have saved the people,&#8221; answered Gabrielle,
whose eyes were shining with the excitement of the
scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me away if you can,&#8221; said the Governor next.
&#8220;Oh, thank God, thank God, at last!&#8221; he cried with a
sudden change of tone, as a volley of musketry was
heard, and a large body of mounted troops dashed
through the crowd and mustered in force round the
statue, on the base of which the three stood.</p>

<p>With the troops round him, the Governor&#8217;s courage
returned, and as his fears vanished his true nature reasserted
itself. He scowled at the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>&#8220;Charge them, charge them, the canaille!&#8221; he cried
passionately. &#8220;Cut them down, the dogs. To threaten
me! Give them the steel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, is this keeping your pledge?&#8221; asked Gerard
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did well, sir monk, you saved my life, and shall
have fitting reward; but this is my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You pledged your honour as a noble of France, my
lord Duke,&#8221; protested Gerard.</p>

<p>At this moment de Proballe broke through the troops
and came hurrying to the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not hurt, my lord, I trust,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not your fault that I was not torn to pieces by
the mob. But for mademoiselle, your niece, and this
good monk, who stopped the mob in the moment of
frenzy, I should have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; exclaimed de Proballe, recognizing
Gerard. &#8220;Do you know who that monk is? The villain
de Cobalt!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor, who stood close to Gerard, stepped
back hastily, as if in fear of some treachery, and when
at a safe distance scowled at him with eyes of hate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; he said between his teeth. &#8220;I promised
you a fitting reward. You shall have it.&#8221; He smiled,
and turning to the soldiers near him, he ordered:
&#8220;Arrest him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not do this, my lord. You cannot be so
cowardly,&#8221; cried Gabrielle, putting herself before Gerard.
But this act only served to infuriate him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest him, I say,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;It is I rule here,
mademoiselle, not you. You shall not protect him and
cannot save him from the fate he merits. You have
done enough ill for the people already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This injustice shall not be done,&#8221; declared Gabrielle
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will answer for this to me, my lord Duke, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
the son of your Suzerain,&#8221; said Gerard, stepping forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I will answer to you and for you; and answer
now, in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He signed to the soldiers, who then laid hands on
Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will appeal to the people,&#8221; cried Gabrielle vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;There shall be substance for your appeal, too,&#8221; he
replied. He was like a man beside himself with passion.
&#8220;He shall not escape me again. Have a space cleared
there,&#8221; he thundered to his men. &#8220;Bring up a file of
men. This man is a spy and the ringleader of all the
tumults to-day. He is condemned to death, and shall
die now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even his officers stood aghast at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand, at least, the appearance of a trial,&#8221; said
Gerard calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been tried already. I know your crimes,
and have tried and condemned you. Do as I say,&#8221; he
thundered to the officers, &#8220;or by the God of Heaven I
shall know how to deal with those who mutiny against
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the son of the Duke of Bourbon, and in his
name I command you to disregard the Governor&#8217;s order,&#8221;
said Gerard in a loud, firm tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie, a lie. Disobey me at your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two of the officers approached and were venturing
upon a remonstrance, when the Governor, mad with his
rage, struck one of them a violent blow on the face and
himself called up a file of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring that villain here,&#8221; he said to the men who held
Gerard. They were too frightened to disobey him.</p>

<p>Gabrielle watched with bated breath, and was springing
forward to again interfere when de Proballe put
himself in her way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>&#8220;My lord, my lord,&#8221; she cried in an agony of distress
and fear. &#8220;I urge you, I beg you not to do this thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Governor was deaf to her entreaty, and having
drawn up the file of men, stood by them, and himself
gave the command in a voice thick with rage.</p>

<p>Gerard faced the men without a tremor.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be a heavy reckoning for all concerned
in this,&#8221; he said; and his voice was as calm and steady
as before.</p>

<p>The Governor&#8217;s command rang out stern and sharp,
and the guns went up to the men&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>Then, with a scream, Gabrielle tore herself from de
Proballe, and snatching a sword from an officer as she
passed, rushed in front of Gerard and held it to her
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he dies, I will plunge this to my heart, and my
blood, with his, shall cry for vengeance upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor listened, his angry eyes fixed on Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do all you have asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried Gerard loudly. &#8220;I will not take my life
on such a condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s pause of acute suspense followed. Then
the Governor nodded and said curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is enough. You have saved his life, mademoiselle.
He shall go free. But first take him to the Castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in a few minutes the troops were on their way
to the Castle, with Gerard in their midst, once more a
prisoner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />


<small>IN THE HALL OF AUDIENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME three or four hours after the rioting in
the market place, Pascal and Lucette, who had
been hurried to the Castle from Babillon&#8217;s house,
were led to the Great Hall of Audience and placed in
the midst of the large crowd of townsfolk who had been
taken prisoners by the troops.</p>

<p>They were all herded together in a space about mid-way
down the southern side of the Great Hall, in a
space set apart by strong barriers and guarded by a ring
of soldiers. Two other companies of soldiers were present,
each about fifty in number, and they were drawn up
one on each side of the da&iuml;s at the eastern end, where
stood the Governor&#8217;s seat of audience and judgment.</p>

<p>Nearly all the prisoners had been injured in the conflict,
and carried some grim evidences of the strife.
Those whose wounds were serious wore such blood-stained
bandages, dressings and slings as they had been
able to improvise; but for the most part the wounds were
undressed, and the men appeared just as they had been
taken, with hair and faces grimed with blood and dirt,
and clothes torn and jagged by the soldiers&#8217; weapons,
making a gruesome sight, which moved Lucette alternately
to shrinking repulsion and tender pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must have been terrible fighting,&#8221; she said
to Pascal, for they knew nothing of what had passed,
and had been told merely that they were to be tried
immediately, with the rest of the prisoners, for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
share in the day&#8217;s work. &#8220;I wonder what has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can find that out; I will question some of the
men,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But I would rather know what is
going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid we shall find that out too quite as quickly
as we wish;&#8221; and Lucette glanced nervously about her
at the men who were guarding the prisoners. She gave
a little shiver of fear as her eyes fell on the Governor&#8217;s
seat, and speculated anxiously what the ceremonious and
somewhat terrifying preparations boded to them all.
From that her gaze passed to the soldiers gathered about
the da&iuml;s, whom she scrutinized closely; and just as Pascal
returned from questioning their fellow-prisoners, she
uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Pascal,&#8221; she whispered eagerly, &#8220;there
is Captain Dubois.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dubois? Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, among the soldiers on the right of the Governor&#8217;s
seat: thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth&mdash;yes, fifteenth
in the second row, counting from the da&iuml;s to the
right. I am sure it&#8217;s he. Do you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See him? I see more than him. Every man in the
ranks there is ours, and Bassot himself is in command.
We shall see something before we are many hours
older, or I am no Bourbon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can Gabrielle be? And M. Gerard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I gather, he is a prisoner; but the men
here know little. There has been a riot in the market place;
and these are some of the rioters. They have
been told only that they are to be tried now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they cannot have reached Malincourt. Oh, I
wonder what they will do to us,&#8221; cried Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how I would punish you were I the judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would trust you,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t like the punishment any more than I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
like the results of your act.&#8221; His tone was half earnest
half jest; and she looked up puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is my crime?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have given us splendid help in many ways;
but I&#8217;m sadly out if our last mischances are not to be
traced to that habit of yours&mdash;of making fools of us
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sadly</i> out! I&#8217;m sadly out if you did not say that
with a rare spice of relish. Sadly, indeed! Is this one
of M. Burgher&#8217;s curtain lectures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were still Madame Burgher, it might be,&#8221;
he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve gone back to Lucette, thank you, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, the Lucette whom the officer at the gate recognized.&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood him then. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
she said eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I don&#8217;t think is not of much account. But I
do think that any man who has once been under fire
from your dark eyes would not readily forget them.
He had not forgotten them, and they set him thinking
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how cruel you are! To blame me in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blame you? It is the fortune of things. But if you
think there&#8217;s a lesson in the thing, that good fellow of
yours, Denys St. Jean, mightn&#8217;t be sorry if you learnt
it. A thing of that sort is pretty much like a forest fire:
you can start it easily, but you never know what may be
burnt or how far it may spread before it&#8217;s put out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be grateful to you for first frightening
and then lecturing me at a time like this,&#8221; cried Lucette
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My punishment to you would be to sentence you to
stop it for the future. That&#8217;s all. And now I&#8217;ve said
my say,&#8221; he answered; and then, with a reassuring laugh,
added: &#8220;As for this, it will be nothing. Have no fear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
We may have a farce of a trial and a sentence after this
Tiger&#8217;s manner; but before he can do anything, the
tables will be turned on him, and he is not unlikely to
find himself where we are. Have no fear, and don&#8217;t be
surprised at anything that happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette was silent for a while, her manner a mixture
of vexation and regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I say I have learnt my lesson, monsieur?&#8221; she
asked with a look half mocking, half serious. &#8220;Your
words have hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you&#8217;ve but a poor memory for lessons,
Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you are unendurable! I don&#8217;t like this lecturer&#8217;s
mood of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s fortunate I don&#8217;t wear it often. You are
too brave and true a girl at heart, Lucette,&#8221; he said
earnestly, &#8220;not to make your good will worth having
for any man. And now I&#8217;ll be serious no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lucette looked serious then, and twice turned to
him as if to say something; although in the end she
shrugged her shoulders and remained silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is going to happen now,&#8221; said Pascal
after a minute, as a number of the Governor&#8217;s suite
entered and ranged themselves near the da&iuml;s. Both were
watching them when Lucette cried suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Gabrielle. Oh, how sad and pale she
looks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She takes it all very seriously,&#8221; replied Pascal; and
pushing through the prisoners, he forced a way for
Lucette and himself to the front. Gabrielle saw, and
hurried to speak to them, when one of the guards stopped
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot speak to the prisoners, mademoiselle,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, fellow,&#8221; exclaimed Pascal angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, prisoner.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_336.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">GERARD BORE HIMSELF WITH GREAT DIGNITY</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>&#8220;Not at your command, I promise you;&#8221; but Gabrielle
making a hasty gesture to them, fell back, and at
the moment there came a blast of trumpets heralding
the approach, as they thought, of the Governor.</p>

<p>But to their amazement, it was Gerard, dressed in
Bourbon uniform and preceded by two courtiers, who
backed before him, bowing deeply as if in profound
respect. One of them was d&#8217;Estelle, whose sallow sardonic
face wore a smile of mockery; and as they entered,
a herald called in loud tones&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Place, there, place, for the most noble Lord Gerard
de Bourbon.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the announcement the men about the Governor&#8217;s
seat made a profound obeisance, and formed a lane to
the steps leading to the da&iuml;s.</p>

<p>Gabrielle trembled, and showed such agitation and
pain that Lucette was full of concern for her, while
Pascal smiled and muttered to himself: &#8220;In the name
of the devil, what can this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerard bore himself with great dignity, though understanding
the thing little better than Pascal. He saw
the smiles of derision which the Governor&#8217;s favourites
exchanged one with another, but paid no heed to them,
and acted as though the scene were no mockery, but
earnest.</p>

<p>He was bowed to the Governor&#8217;s chair, and as he took
his seat the Bourbon colours were suddenly unfurled,
one on either side.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Grace the Duke de Rochelle entreats your lordship
to be seated here, and will wait upon you to make
his homage to your lordship as the representative of the
illustrious Duke de Bourbon, the gracious Suzerain of
Morvaix.&#8221; It was d&#8217;Estelle who said this, and his
cynical smile was answered by the sneers of every courtier
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to receive his homage,&#8221; said Gerard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
as he stood by the Great Seat and looked about him.
In his surprise he had not noticed Gabrielle when entering;
but in a moment he saw her and went to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can this mockery portend, Gerard?&#8221; she asked
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, I know not. The Governor seeks to amuse
himself, I gather; but I care not so long as he does but
waste enough time over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has some sinister meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he will find, if he will but mock long enough,&#8221;
he answered drily. &#8220;Meanwhile, we will play up to him
in a way he will find little to his liking. Come. I will
have a seat placed for you by my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Let us not anger him further,&#8221; she said,
shrinking. &#8220;It is not prudent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His anger is nothing to us. In an hour or two at
most he will be on his knees to us, in no mocking mood,
I promise you. Come;&#8221; and he took her hand, and
leading her to the da&iuml;s he ordered d&#8217;Estelle to place a
chair for her by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no commands of the kind, most noble lord,&#8221;
he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I command here now. Do as I bid you,&#8221; answered
Gerard sternly; and after a second&#8217;s hesitation it was
done.</p>

<p>The moment after Gabrielle had taken her seat the
soldier next Dubois let his musket drop, and at the
clanging noise Gerard looked round and saw Dubois.
It was a device to attract his attention to the fact that
the whole of Bassot&#8217;s company were present.</p>

<p>Dubois, with a meaning glance, looked across to the
prisoners, and Gerard, following the direction of his
eyes, saw Pascal and Lucette. His face maintained its
grave set expression; but his eyes were full of meaning
as he met Pascal&#8217;s and glanced first at the prisoners and
then at the men guarding them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>&#8220;We are well prepared, indeed, Gabrielle,&#8221; he whispered
to her. &#8220;Dubois has conceived a plan daring
even for him. Pascal is among the prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him, and Lucette too; but they would
not let me speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needs no speech. He understands. He will lead
the prisoners when the moment comes, and they will
overpower the men in charge of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the soldiers here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are Bourbons to a man and Dubois is among them&mdash;eating
out his heart, I will wager, for the moment when
he can strike. Ah! here comes the Governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen the Duchess, Gerard, and she is coming
hither,&#8221; whispered Gabrielle quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; it will all help to waste time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor, with de Proballe and others in attendance,
entered then, and he gave a start of anger at seeing
Gabrielle by Gerard&#8217;s side. He suppressed it quickly,
however, and made his way with an affectation of respect
toward Gerard. De Proballe, save for an occasional
smirk, was preternaturally grave as he followed close
to the Governor, bowing at every step with a grotesque,
exaggerated obsequiousness that drew smiles from all.</p>

<p>Not an act or gesture of all this escaped Gerard, who
saw through the childish contemptible burlesque by
which it was designed to insult and humiliate him; but
he continued to act precisely as he would have acted had
the ceremony been genuine. He remained seated while
the Governor approached the da&iuml;s and said, with a last
low bow&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to offer my most humble greetings to my
lord Gerard de Bourbon, and to bid you welcome to
Morvaix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your recognition of my right and rank as the son
of Morvaix&#8217; Suzerain comes somewhat late, my lord
Duke, and my previous reception at your hands was but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
an indifferent preface to this more fitting sequel. That
preface yet remains to be explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not then convinced myself that you were indeed
Great Bourbon&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, then, now convinced?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should I be here and you where you sit were it not
so, most noble lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, then, has convinced you? Your answer does
not satisfy me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a matter to be more conveniently discussed
between us in private. All is well with our illustrious
Suzerain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My purpose in Morvaix is not concerned with the
passing of mere idle compliments, and I bear no other
greeting to your lordship than that you have already
received and destroyed&mdash;an act you may now be anxious
to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your noble lordship&#8217;s&mdash;condescension amazes me,&#8221;
said the Governor, with a pause before the word, easy
for all to understand. &#8220;You speak of a purpose. Will
you be good enough to explain it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am indeed glad to do so to all present,&#8221; answered
Gerard readily, rising. He welcomed the chance of letting
the prisoners hear it. &#8220;My father, the Duke de
Bourbon, the Suzerain of Morvaix, had heard ill reports
of your government here: that your rule was harsh;
that the people were oppressed by your soldiers; that
justice was denied to the citizens, who were crushed and
ruined by the imposition of iniquitous taxation; and
further, that many dark and evil practices prevailed.
He has sent me here, therefore, bearing full powers to
inquire into the methods of your government and to
redress the grievances of the suffering people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor and those round him sneered and
laughed; but the prisoners listened intently to every
word, and not understanding that the scene was no more
than burlesque, one of them cried in a loud voice&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>&#8220;God save your lordship! Long live Bourbon!&#8221; and
the cry was caught up by the whole body of prisoners
and of Bourbon troops swelling into loud shouts, which,
for the moment, the guards tried in vain to silence.</p>

<p>The Governor paled with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship knows how to appeal to the passions
of such canaille,&#8221; he said, when silence had been partly
restored.</p>

<p>&#8220;The passions have first been provoked by your misrule,
my lord Duke,&#8221; answered Gerard in his stern ringing
tone, to the delight of every one of the prisoners,
who believed that justice was indeed at last to be meted
out to the ruler they detested. Gerard observed the
change in them, and saw, with intense satisfaction, that
their mood was now such as would make them ready
helpers in the scene to follow. &#8220;Who are these prisoners?&#8221;
he asked the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their presence here is in accord with half my present
purpose, most noble lord. I have deemed it best
that they should be tried before you, illustrious Bourbon&#8217;s
son, that you should know their crimes and yourself
decree their punishment, you being, as I know you
to be, the essence of justice and purity itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this de Proballe laughed audibly; and the sneer
passed round the courtiers. It was he who had suggested
to the Governor this mocking masquerade and
the burlesque treatment of Gerard, and the irony of the
scene delighted him.</p>

<p>But Gerard gave not a sign that he even saw the sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was well arranged, my lord,&#8221; he said gravely.
&#8220;And the other part in your purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a personal affair, personal to the lady at your
side and myself.&#8221; His look conveyed his meaning, and
Gabrielle flinched.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know your meaning,&#8221; answered Gerard
with unmoved composure, &#8220;and shall be glad to assist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
in furthering such a matter. But first, the prisoners.
What is the charge and the evidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe stepped forward here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most noble and puissant lord Gerard of Bourbon,&#8221;
he began with an insolent air, when Gerard interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay,&#8221; he said, with an imperious gesture. &#8220;I will
not hear the Baron de Proballe. I know him to be
incapable of telling the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>De Proballe fell back at this insult, and in a voice
vibrating with passion exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your lordship endure this insolence longer?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Governor was rarely troubled when any one
other than himself was humiliated. He was now, in
truth, rather inclined to rejoice at de Proballe&#8217;s discomfiture,
and replied with more than a dash of contempt&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not forget, monsieur, that the lord Gerard
comes from Paris with special knowledge we do not
possess in Morvaix;&#8221; and the favourites round, taking
their cue from this tone, sneered one to another with significant
shrugs and glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evidence, my lord?&#8221; said Gerard with a show
of impatience.</p>

<p>The Governor called up one of his officers then, who
spoke of the affray in the market place; and Gerard,
under cover of a desire to get at the truth, questioned
him at considerable length, and so consumed much invaluable
time. Two other officers followed, and some of
the soldiers who had been injured by the crowd.</p>

<p>Having prolonged the matter as long as practicable,
Gerald said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one point on which none of the witnesses
have spoken. The provocation which drove the people
to revolt? I would hear that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was none,&#8221; answered the Governor, who was
now wearying of the farce. &#8220;And, moreover, these proceedings
have lasted long enough.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>&#8220;We will, then, hear the prisoners themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the law in Morvaix,&#8221; was the curt reply.
&#8220;They were caught red-handed, and can make no defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that your Morvaix justice, my lord? I am not
surprised there is discontent, therefore. I will consider
the matter I have heard, and give my judgment on the
morrow. Meanwhile the prisoners will be released.&#8221;</p>

<p>They broke out into joyous shouts at this, and again
the cries of &#8220;Long live Bourbon!&#8221; rent the air, to the
intense mortification and anger of the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too much,&#8221; he said with a scowl. &#8220;Your
lordship will not be here on the morrow. I am sending
you to-night on your way with an escort.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gerard having his own end in view, affected not
to hear him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now the second matter you mentioned, my
lord?&#8221; he asked; &#8220;affecting Mademoiselle de Malincourt
here and yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is one that will doubtless please you,&#8221; answered
the Governor. The burlesque so far had brought him
far less pleasure than mortification; but he was now sure
of his ground. He intended to make Gerard the medium
of announcing his betrothal to Gabrielle, and the thought
of this triumph of ingenuity appealed to him. &#8220;Mademoiselle
de Malincourt has been pleased to consent to
betroth herself to me, most noble lord; and your gracious
presence makes this a fitting opportunity for the fact to
be announced. You will be good enough to announce it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was a threat, and as such Gerard understood
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betrothal?&#8221; he repeated, with an excellent simulation
of surprise, as if ignorant of the whole matter.
&#8220;But is there not already one Duchess de Rochelle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the facts well,&#8221; answered the Governor,
dropping all form in his anger. &#8220;Do what I say, or
there may be bitter reasons to regret it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>But Gerard was a far better actor than he, and replied
in a very loud tone, as if more surprised than ever&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to announce to all present that,
having already one wife, you propose to take a second?
This is against the laws of France, my lord. I cannot
make such an announcement.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor bit his lip and frowned, and said, in a
threatening undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish to leave Morvaix to-night with your
head on your shoulders, you will announce it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are tearing off the mask, then, at last,&#8221; said
Gerard, as calmly as before, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess herself has agreed to a divorce, so that
this marriage may take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a union I cannot and will not sanction,&#8221; declared
Gerard in a loud firm voice. &#8220;In the name of the Suzerain
of Morvaix I forbid it. It must and shall not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see to that and have an end to this mockery,&#8221;
cried the Governor, turning to give an order to
his officers. But before he could deliver it an interruption
came. The Duchess de Rochelle was borne into
the hall on a litter.</p>

<p>Dead silence fell on all as her litter was set down at
the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the Duchess to speak for herself,&#8221; said
Gerard.</p>

<p>She was pale and fragile, but her eyes were burning,
and her soft voice thrilled all as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard what has passed, my lord,&#8221; she said
to Gerard; &#8220;and I have come here to protest against
this contemplated wrong&mdash;the last of many I have endured
at my husband&#8217;s hands. I will not have that
innocent girl sacrificed. I protest solemnly against this
infamy, in the name of God, the Holy Church, and of
the laws of France.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effort seemed to exhaust her strength, and as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
fell back faint and white, Gabrielle ran and knelt beside
her.</p>

<p>Gerard paused for the Governor to speak, but rage
deprived him of words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What say you now, my lord?&#8221; asked Gerard.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a plot against me&mdash;a damnable scheme to try
and put me to shame here,&#8221; cried the infuriated Governor.
&#8220;You shall have an answer, never fear; and one
little to your liking. Seize that man,&#8221; he cried to his
officers, pointing to Gerard with a hand that shook with
rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should not the hall be cleared?&#8221; said de Proballe,
roused to great alarm for himself now at the fiasco of
his plans.</p>

<p>The answer came from Gerard in a loud tone that
resounded through the vast hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;not until the infamy of this thing
has been made public.&#8221;</p>

<p>A profound hush of expectancy fell upon the great
throng, each man holding his breath in wonderment and
suspense; and before it was broken, an officer entered
hurriedly and approached the Governor&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord, my lord,&#8221; he said excitedly; &#8220;I crave your
lordship&#8217;s pardon. Captain Boutelle has sent me to report
that a large force of troops are approaching the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At last,&#8221; whispered Gerard under his breath, with a
deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The Governor turned to two of his captains near him&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go at once, Des Moulins, and you, Courvoir, and
see what this means. Close the gates against them, and
hold them in parley till I come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men hurried out in company with the officer who
had brought the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear the hall, Captain Fourtier; drive these canaille
back to the prisons until I can deal with them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; cried Gerard, springing to his feet. &#8220;No one
leaves the hall except at my orders. The force you hear
of is a Bourbon army coming here under my command.
Your power is broken, my lord Duke. Who disobeys
me now will answer to the Suzerain Duke, Great Bourbon,
for his disobedience. Bear the Duchess away.
Gabrielle, you had better leave with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, you shall rue this insolent presumption!
Let the hall be cleared, I say. It is I, the Governor, who
order it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Great Hall became now the scene of intense excitement
and commotion.</p>

<p>The guards commenced to obey the Governor&#8217;s command
to drive the prisoners back to the cells. Groans
and hooting broke out, and in the confusion Lucette contrived
to slip past the soldiers and hasten to Gabrielle,
and with her left by the side of the Duchess&#8217; litter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pascal, now,&#8221; called Gerard. &#8220;Captain Dubois, post
your men at the doors, and see that no one enters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me, those who are for Bourbon,&#8221; shouted Pascal.
&#8220;Down with the guards!&#8221; and he flung himself upon
the soldier nearest to him, and wrenching his musket
from him, began to use it vigorously. This was the signal
for a fierce conflict between the prisoners and the
guards; and in the meanwhile Dubois, sending half his
men to guard the entrance to the hall, drew up the remainder
as a bodyguard to protect Gerard, who had left
the da&iuml;s and was now threatened by the officers and
courtiers of the Governor.</p>

<p>The two bodies faced each other with fierce menacing
looks: the Governor heading his courtiers, and Gerard
his men, Dubois close at his side; while the din and
clamour of the fight between prisoners and soldiers rendered
it impossible for a word to be heard.</p>

<p>The struggle was not long. The prisoners outnumbered
their opponents by three or four to one, and fought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
with the courage of men fighting for their freedom.
They had Pascal to lead them, moreover; and he had
clubbed his musket and laid about him with an energy
and strength which none could resist wherever he went.
And he was everywhere where the fight was thickest;
and the stronger men, inspired by his example, seized
the soldiers&#8217; weapons and fought shoulder to shoulder
with him with terrible effect.</p>

<p>The tables were soon turned, and the guards were
beaten and overthrown or held prisoners by the men who
a few minutes before had been cowering before them.</p>

<p>Before it ended, however, another struggle commenced.
The Governor, mad with rage, called upon
those with him, and drawing his sword, rushed at Gerard
to cut him down, unarmed as he was. But Dubois had
anticipated this, and his sword met that of the Duke, who
sought with all his skill and trick of fence to break
through the other&#8217;s guard.</p>

<p>The two were soon left fighting almost alone, for the
Bourbon soldiers, maddened by the treacherous attempt
upon Gerard&#8217;s life, attacked the courtiers with a right
good will, and drove them back speedily to the wall with
the fury of their onslaught. There they were speedily
disarmed, but not until several of them had been
wounded.</p>

<p>As the din of the conflict within the hall died down at
the ignominious defeat of the Governor&#8217;s supporters,
there came from outside the sound of heavy firing and
the loud shouts of many men engaged in desperate fighting.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is d&#8217;Alembert; I hear the Bourbon cry,&#8221; shouted
Pascal, hurrying to one of the entrances.</p>

<p>Gerard called to the Governor to yield; and Dubois,
hearing this, changed his defensive tactics for those of
vigorous attack, and as he was driving the Governor
before him, he stepped back suddenly, and so brought
the duel to an end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>&#8220;Now, my lord, you must see the uselessness of further
resistance,&#8221; said Gerard. &#8220;You will give me your
sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a treacherous dog like you? Never!&#8221; was the
fierce answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you speak of treachery? I saved your life to-day
in the market place, thinking that some spark of
honour might remain to you to be roused by the act&mdash;and
your reward was an order that I should be shot.
And but now you sought to drive your sword into my
heart, unarmed though I was. I will have no mercy
for you: nothing but justice. Come, your sword. You
are powerless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Governor had a curse on his lips, but checked it,
as a great shout came from Pascal and the Bourbons
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Castle is ours, my lord. D&#8217;Alembert is here,&#8221;
cried Pascal; and the Bourbon soldiers came streaming
into the hall, with d&#8217;Alembert at their head.</p>

<p>The Governor glanced round him with the look of a
hunted beast, and then said sullenly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no option, it seems.&#8221; He held out his sword
as if about to give it up; but, with a sudden change, he
uttered a cry of rage, and lunged forward swiftly at
Gerard&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>Only just did the thrust miss as Gerard, fortunately
suspicious, had noted the change of look and leapt aside.</p>

<p>With a curse at himself for his failure, the Governor
sprang from the men who rushed up, and plunged the
sword into his own heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />


<small>THE TROOPS MARCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE week that followed was a wild one indeed
for Morvaix, and the citizens, freed suddenly
from the blighting curse of the Tiger&#8217;s rule,
gave themselves up, all classes alike, to a carnival of
revelry and rejoicing.</p>

<p>The news of the strange occurrences which had culminated
in the Governor&#8217;s death was carried far and
wide through the city the same night by the liberated
prisoners, who streamed out of the Castle in a gay
throng, laughing and jesting, straining their throats with
shouts and cheers for Gerard and Gabrielle, Bourbon
and Malincourt, and jostling and shouldering one
another in the mad race to be first to tell the glad tidings.</p>

<p>A garbled and distorted tale it was they told in describing
the scene, the true meaning of which, although
they had witnessed it, they could but imperfectly understand.
But the main fact spoke for itself. The Tyrant
was dead&mdash;had died by his own hand, rather than face
the anger of the Great Bourbon who had brought an
army to punish him and save the city.</p>

<p>They had seen this with their own eyes, and with their
own ears had heard the words with which Gerard had
afterwards dismissed them, promising solemnly good
government for the future, relief from the grinding taxation
and redress for their long suffered wrongs. And
the whole livelong night was spent in rejoicing.</p>

<p>The morrow found the great news confirmed. A
proclamation was issued from the Castle announcing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
that the Duc de Rochelle was dead, and that Gerard de
Bourbon would act for the time as Governor, and this
was followed by Gerard&#8217;s first decree as Governor, repealing
some of the Tyrant&#8217;s ordinances, and detailing a
number of measures to be taken immediately for the
relief of the poorer citizens.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. The leading burghers were summoned
to the Castle and informed of the forthcoming
alliance between the Houses of Bourbon and Malincourt
through the marriage of Gerard and Gabrielle; and told
that Gerard hoped to remain permanently in Morvaix
as the Governor of the Province. The burghers were
also requested to take urgent counsel together as to the
best means to be adopted to restore the impaired trade
and fortunes of the city; and were thus sent on their way
rejoicing with lighter hearts than they had known for
many a long year.</p>

<p>A few days wrought wonders in changing the look
of the little city and the demeanour of the people, who
had many a substantial proof of the spirit of the new
rule; and before the week was out it was known that
couriers had passed between Morvaix and the Duke de
Bourbon and that they had brought back from the Suzerain
confirmation of Gerard&#8217;s appointment as the new
Governor.</p>

<p>A crowd of smiling men and women were gathered in
the market place cheering and rejoicing over this fresh
good news, when two horsemen came riding from the
Castle toward the south gate. They were de Proballe
and Jacques Dauban; and of all the great throng their
faces alone were dark and gloomy. Gerard had held
de Proballe a close prisoner, intending to punish him
severely; but at Gabrielle&#8217;s intercession had released him,
on condition that he and Dauban left the city never to
return to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so happy, let us forgive,&#8221; she had pleaded;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
and herself had provided her uncle with a sum of money.
But Pascal had not forgiven Dauban, and learning when
he and his master were to be released, had whispered a
word to Babillon which had results.</p>

<p>As the two men reached the farther end of the market place,
where it narrowed into the street leading to the
city gate, they found the press of people so great that
no more than a walking pace was possible; and just at
that moment they were recognized. Cries and hooting,
coarse jests and gibes, took the place of smiles and
cheers; clenched fists were raised in menace, as the people
closed round the horses, rough hands being laid on
the bridles.</p>

<p>De Proballe scowled in anger, and when one man
seized the bridle of his horse and jeered at him to his
face, he was foolhardy enough in his rage to raise his
whip and strike the man across the mouth.</p>

<p>It was the spark to the tinder, and the flame burst out
directly. In a moment he and Dauban were torn from
their horses and jostled and shouldered and thrust from
hand to hand, in the midst of a rough but not over ill-tempered
crowd.</p>

<p>Babillon was close at hand, and himself raised the cry
of &#8220;No violence on such a day as this. No violence.&#8221;
And the cry was caught up by the people, and followed
by bursts of thunderous jeering laughter at the sour
looks and angry faces of the two men. It was rough
jesting, however; and just when the people were tiring
of it and the pair were getting back to their horses, a
cry was raised by some one of &#8220;The pond, the pond;&#8221;
and this, too, swelled into a roar.</p>

<p>Dauban was seized first by half a dozen stalwart fellows,
and, writhing, struggling and kicking in futile resistance,
was borne along and tossed into the middle of
the pond which was near. He emerged a minute later,
a shivering, soaked, half-drowned and all-bedraggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
figure to be greeted, as he shook himself and stood
squeezing the dirty water from his clothes, with such a
roar of raucous laughter as might have been heard
through half the city.</p>

<p>De Proballe&#8217;s turn came next; and despite his angry,
vehement protests, he was seized in the same manner,
and carried, fighting and screaming out impotent threats
and curses, in the direction of the pond.</p>

<p>But before his ruthless captors reached the pond, an
interruption came. Gerard and Gabrielle, with some
others in attendance, had been riding, and were returning,
when their attention was attracted by the sounds of
the disturbance, and they came in full view of the proceedings
just when Dauban stood shivering after his
ducking and the crowd had seized upon de Proballe.</p>

<p>Gerard was for letting the thing be settled by the people,
but Gabrielle would not, and with a touch of the
spur, put her horse in the way.</p>

<p>Her appearance was the signal for a rousing cheer,
and as soon as she could be heard, she said to those about
her&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not best show yourselves my friends in this.
If you will please me, you will let M. de Proballe free.
If I have forgiven him, cannot you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout of assent was the answer; and in a moment
he was set at liberty; the two horses were brought up,
and he and Dauban mounted, a wild burst of laughter
at the figure which Dauban made being mingled in the
cheers for Gabrielle and Malincourt.</p>

<p>De Proballe said not a word of thanks, and would not
even look at Gabrielle; and as he passed close to Gerard
it was with a scowl and an oath. Then he dug his heels
into his horse&#8217;s flanks and rode out of the city and into
the open country, closely followed by Dauban, who kept
glancing timorously over his shoulder in fear of yet
further trouble.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>&#8220;I would not have had either of them hurt,&#8221; said
Gabrielle, when Gerard joined her and they resumed the
ride to the maison.</p>

<p>&#8220;A kindliness worthy of your gentle heart, Gabrielle.
But I am differently cast, I fear. It would not have
hurt him. He has stirred much dirty water in Morvaix,
and if he had had to carry away a little of a different
kind in his mouth and on his clothes it would have served
him right. But he has had a good fright, and that&#8217;s
something; and if you are glad no worse has chanced
to him, why I am glad also. I would rather he had a
dry skin than you be displeased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is best as it is, Gerard, although&mdash;it would have
served him right;&#8221; and she laughed and added: &#8220;I
could almost have wished we had not ridden up in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, it gave the people a chance of seeing more evidence
of your sweet nature, Gabrielle. How they
cheered you! &#8217;Twas a good-humoured crowd, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have changed the temper of the people almost
as if by the wave of a wizard&#8217;s wand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. &#8217;Twas you they cheered. They know whom
to thank. Your popularity is so great that you set me
a difficult task to rival it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How different from that angry sullen mob that faced
the soldiers when we first met&mdash;and but little more than
a week ago.&#8221; And in this easy happy fashion they chatted
until Malincourt was reached.</p>

<p>On the terrace they found Lucette and Denys, now
fast on the road to recovery, in converse with Dubois.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was chiding Captain Dubois for leaving us, Gabrielle,&#8221;
cried Lucette smiling. &#8220;But he has an iron will&mdash;shot-proof
against any arguments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could persuade him to remain, Lucette,&#8221;
said Gerard. &#8220;I have tried to bribe him with the offer
of the command of the troops here, but he is, as you say,
iron, and insists on leaving to-morrow with d&#8217;Alembert.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>&#8220;I am a soldier, mademoiselle,&#8221; answered Dubois, &#8220;and
there is news of some fighting yet to be done. My place
is with Bourbon&#8217;s army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours will be a Bourbon army, too, friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you, my lord, urge me no more. I have arranged
the matters on which we spoke. The mercenaries
who were in the late Governor&#8217;s troops have for
the most part been enrolled in the companies that march
to-morrow, and so many of the Bourbon men as you
desired have taken their places. But your force will be
chiefly Morvaix men&mdash;a sort of citizens&#8217; army; and to
command such a force is no more to my liking than it
is fitted to my powers. I should but cause you infinite
trouble by being constantly at loggerheads with your
burghers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take them too seriously, captain. They are
worthy men,&#8221; said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;As men most worthy, doubtless, mademoiselle; as
talkers, unsurpassed in France, I think; but I am a plain
soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like details of your arrangements now they
are completed, Dubois. Come into the house and give
them to me. Denys may well assist at the conference, for
he will now be high in my esteem and confidence. Come,
Denys&mdash;if Lucette will spare you to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Denys flushed with pleasure, and Lucette smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a wonderful change in everything, Gabrielle,&#8221;
she exclaimed when the three men had left them. &#8220;How
happy you look. And what a little cheat you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Innocent! Why the day after M. Gerard met you
in the market place. When you said that if for a moment
you had swerved from thoughts of duty, a night&#8217;s
reflection had sobered you. Sobered you! Intoxicated
you, you should have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that Gerard was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Lucette broke
in with a merry laugh, and Gabrielle blushed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>&#8220;Was Gerard de Cobalt? Nor was he. But do you
remember my words, when you were such a philosopher
about the plagues of love? I told you you would learn
to know it all some day. Oh, Gabrielle, what a lecture
I might read you now! You cannot find him near you
without a dozen tremors and a fleeting tide of colour in
your face and light in your eyes; and when he is not by
your side, how restless is Gabrielle, with glances here
and glances there, listening for his footstep or his voice,
and impatience, oh, such impatience, at all that keeps
him from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I plead guilty, has the court no mercy for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest, I love you for it. But I told you how
it would be; and God knows neither you nor I would
have it otherwise. Ah, here is M. Pascal,&#8221; she said as
he came round the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle, I have hastened from the city to crave
your pardon,&#8221; he said to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are already assured of it, monsieur, for I know
the offence will be but a trifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not trust all men, Gabrielle,&#8221; put in Lucette
briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet unwittingly I may have offended. It was I who
instigated the baiting of M. de Proballe and the scurvy
knave he calls his secretary. I knew when he would
leave, and set on Babillon to frighten him. I have heard
it was against your wish, and would not have you blame
your citizens for the act of a rough Bourbon soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to them?&#8221; asked Lucette. And
when Pascal told her of Dauban&#8217;s treatment, she laughed
and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tack a condition to my pardon, monsieur?&#8221;
asked Gabrielle, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were I one of your cautious burghers, I would urge
that the condition be first specified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that you do not leave with the Bourbon forces
to-morrow, but remain to be a friend and help to us all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>&#8220;Then I pray you undo the tacking. Remember how
sad a place Morvaix must ever be in my memory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sad?&#8221; exclaimed Lucette. &#8220;Monsieur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean because of my many bereavements here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bereavements, monsieur?&#8221; said Gabrielle, with a
frown of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bereavements truly; what else? &#8217;Twas here in Morvaix
I lost my wife, after a union of but a few minutes;
and after that my newly betrothed was snatched from
me by inexorable fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both laughed, and Lucette said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are desolate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In truth could I be otherwise? I am always, and
in earnest what Gerard was in masquerade for a few
hours&mdash;a courier of fortune; and without the hope that
the fortune I chased may prove as charming and delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would you could have stayed, monsieur; and I
thank you for your pretty compliments,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
smiling and blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to Paris, monsieur, I understand,&#8221; said
Lucette. &#8220;Doubtless there you will find consolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Paris there may be distractions, even if not consolation,&#8221;
he answered gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to persuade him to remain, Lucette,&#8221; said Gabrielle,
going into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will you not remain, M. Pascal?&#8221; asked Lucette
half nervously and more seriously than usual with
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not the answer there, with her, Lucette, and here
perhaps with you?&#8221; He spoke lightly, but his eyes
were serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that I understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am sure there is no need that you should.
They will be a happy pair, I hope with all my heart; as
I hope indeed that you will be happy with M. St. Jean&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
prince of worthy fellows&mdash;even if a trifle disposed to
jealousy. I have had much talk with him in the last
few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent a moment turning over a ring on her
finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will be happy also.&#8221; Her voice was soft
and low and trembled slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a soldier and love my colours. I have health
and strength, a sound body and a modicum of wits, trust
in myself and strong hope, and kindly memories to carry
with me from Morvaix. Why should I not be happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Despite your bereavements?&#8221; And she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps because of them, Lucette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A double-edged sentence that, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And therefore best suited to the thought behind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes and looked at him searchingly, and
he met the look with an easy smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you mean?&#8221; she said, so earnestly
that her tone was almost sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wonder is not greater than my own,&#8221; he
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In our worst troubles recently you laughed. You
have a laugh for everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The finest mask with which Nature ever fitted man
or woman is a laugh, Lucette. Yes, I can laugh at my
own follies and wishes and troubles and&mdash;aye, even at
my own bereavements.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gaiety of his tone was just as bright and free;
and he continued to smile when Lucette again looked
at him earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that smile a mask, too? I would gladly know
what is behind it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I myself shall know better when, say, there
are twenty leagues between Morvaix and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood looking one at the other a moment, and
then Denys came out and joined them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;Come to my rescue, Denys,&#8221; cried Pascal gaily.
&#8220;Here is Madame Burgher trying to cross-examine me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, come and take a lesson in word fencing,
Denys,&#8221; said Lucette.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may need many lessons when you fence with
Lucette, my good friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; replied Denys with a smile, as he slipped
his arm into hers and glanced at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;They would keep me in Morvaix,&#8221; laughed Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;And not they alone, Pascal. Do you know, Lucette,
I have tried by the hour to persuade him to stay. But
he tells me there are&mdash;shall I say it?&#8221; and he looked at
Pascal, who shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;There are a
woman&#8217;s eyes calling him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warning me away, was what I said, friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the same thing,&#8221; declared Denys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe; but &#8217;twas the term I used. I think I have
learnt to read more warnings than beckonings in
women&#8217;s eyes. But &#8217;tis the same in the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucette watched him steadily as he spoke, and then
surprised Denys by saying very seriously, and with something
very much like a sigh&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that be the reason, it is well that you go, Pascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, have you changed sides, Lucette?&#8221; cried
Denys, rallying her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a woman&#8217;s way, Denys, and ever will be,&#8221;
laughed Pascal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever you go, Pascal, I wish you Godspeed with
all my heart,&#8221; said Lucette in the same earnest, almost
strenuous tone; and gave him her hand, which he carried
to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denys will not mind that, at any rate,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Lucette shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me in, Denys, I am chilled,&#8221; she said; and without
saying more or looking again at Pascal, she hurried
in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a woman&#8217;s way, Denys, only and always a
woman&#8217;s way,&#8221; he said, as Denys lingered a moment
and then hurried after her.</p>

<p>Pascal watched them with a smile until they had gone,
and then turned grave, nodded once or twice, smiled
again, and again was grave, until, with a shrug of the
shoulders, he turned and swung away.</p>

<p>The next morning all was bustle and commotion at
the Castle, for the Bourbon troops were marching out.
Gerard and Gabrielle and all from Malincourt were there
to bid them farewell. They stood together, the centre
of a large group, watching them start, and Lucette and
Denys were a little apart from the rest.</p>

<p>Dubois, taciturn and quiet as usual, was busy seeing
that everything was in due order; and Pascal, activity
itself, moved gaily here, there and everywhere in the
ranks, with eyes for everything and everybody, laughing
and jesting in uncontrollable spirits.</p>

<p>His company was the last to start, and all his soldiers,
although many of them were leaving behind friends in
Morvaix and breaking pleasant associations, seemed to
take the infection of their leader&#8217;s gaiety, and faced the
parting with laughs and jokes and pleasantry.</p>

<p>The merriest and most cheerful of all the companies
was Pascal&#8217;s, and he himself the merriest and most cheerful
of them, as they saluted Gerard and cheered Gabrielle
and then marched away with sturdy, stalwart stride.</p>

<p>Pascal waited to mount his horse until almost the last
ranks were on the move.</p>

<p>&#8220;What spirits he has,&#8221; exclaimed Denys to Lucette as
they stood watching the men. &#8220;I am sorry he is going.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lucette was silent.</p>

<p>The last rank passed, and then Pascal, turning in the
saddle, waved his hand and smiled. His eyes rested for
a moment on Lucette&#8217;s, at least so it seemed to her; and
she raised her kerchief and waved back to him just as he
touched his horse and moved after his men.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>She continued to wave and to stare after him, but he
did not look back until, quite in the distance, he turned
and again, as she thought, looked at her; and again she
answered, waving to him.</p>

<p>He did not look back any more, and when, the last sign
of the troops having disappeared and she was still staring
after them, Denys touched her arm, she started
almost as one awakened from a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad he has gone,&#8221; she said, sighing; and then
Denys saw that her eyes were dimmed with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tears? Lucette?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It strains one&#8217;s eyes to stare so long. Give me your
arm, Denys dear, and be patient with me to-day. I&mdash;I&mdash;oh,
Denys dearest, I am so glad you are well again,&#8221; and
she walked away clinging closely to his side.</p>

<p>And Denys, not understanding this mood of hers, was
almost as much perplexed by her humour as he was delighted
by her tenderness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph3"><span class="u">Good Fiction Worth Reading.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>GUY FAWKES.</b> A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Gunpowder Plot&#8221; was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</b> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth. 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>A book rather out of the ordinary is this &#8220;Spirit of the Border.&#8221; The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian &#8220;Village
of Peace&#8221; are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p><b>RICHELIEU.</b> A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal&#8217;s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar&#8217;s conspiracy:
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the state-craft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>DARNLEY.</b> A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>In point of publication, &#8220;Darnley&#8221; Is that work by Mr. James which
follows &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that &#8220;Darnley&#8221; came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>

<p>As a historical romance &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic &#8220;field of the cloth of
gold&#8221; would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>

<p><b>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE.</b> By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U.S.N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
&#8220;who go down in ships&#8221; been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is &#8220;Captain Brand,&#8221;
who, as the author states on his title page, was a &#8220;pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.&#8221; As a sea story pure and simple, &#8220;Captain Brand&#8221; has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>NICK OF THE WOODS.</b> A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
&#8220;Nick of the Woods&#8221; will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird&#8217;s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE.</b> A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</b> A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>This romance of the &#8220;Tower of London&#8221; depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING.</b> A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>GARTHOWEN.</b> A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character&mdash;the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.&#8221;&mdash;Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>MIFANWY.</b> The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.&#8221;&mdash;Boston Herald.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>WINDSOR CASTLE.</b> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>&#8220;Windsor Castle&#8221; is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. &#8220;Bluff King Hal,&#8221; although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King&#8217;s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</b> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p>Take it all in all, &#8220;Horseshoe Robinson&#8221; is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE PEARL OF ORR&#8217;S ISLAND.</b> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>Written prior to 1862, the &#8220;Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the &#8220;sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr&#8217;s Island,&#8221; and straightway
comes &#8220;the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel&#8217;s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in &#8220;The Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
